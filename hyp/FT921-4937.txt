A CEASEFIRE in Moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic home of the Russian-speaking minority
The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the Moldovan authorities dominated by ethnic Romanians and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr
The Trans Dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh has been a source of tension between Azeris and Armenians for centuries
When it did in 1989 a language movement quickly put the hardline Communist Party on the defensive and it lost power in 1990 to the present nationalist government headed by President Mircea Snegur the former secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee
From the beginning of the nationalist movement it was clear that the Russian and to a lesser extent the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations and finally last year proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president Mr Igor Smirnov
