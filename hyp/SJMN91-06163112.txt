Mount Pinatubo the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six centuries of quiet is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with force comparable to the Mount St Helens explosion a US government scientist said Monday
"I think we could see a major explosive eruption any time" said Peter Lipman a volcanologist at the US Geological Survey office in Menlo Park
Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April when it first stirred
A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11500 feet above the volcano today spreading ash over a six-mile radius the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said
Also in peril are the 350000 residents of Angeles City where the air base is located about 50 miles north of Manila
Even if the volcano does not erupt the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least Lipman said
Pinatubo's last eruption 600 years ago is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St Helens did when it erupted in 1980
Until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring it had not been studied well
Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985
"In the worst case a really big eruption all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash Lipman said
