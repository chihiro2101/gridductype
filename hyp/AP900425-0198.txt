After years of delay and a last-minute snag the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and glinting in the sunlight drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds
``The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said
``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work''
The $15 billion telescope was released at 338 pm EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned
The shuttle then backed away
``Thank you very much for the ride'' said Mike Harrington director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Md
She and McCandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission
Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 am EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high above the shuttle
Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place in space
The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back
The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday exposing the finely polished 945-inch mirror to starlight
If all goes well the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base Calif
NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope _ of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ on Tuesday
He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang theory of creation
