A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the ``Voyage of the Damned'' was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane officials said Tuesday
``They're going to have to move it'' said Coast Guard spokeswoman Veronica Cady
The 85-foot Ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast
It was sunk June 4 50 years after the US Coast Guard turned away the SS St Louis as its more than 900 Jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the Holocaust
The sinking site was supposed to be near where the Coast Guard intercepted the St Louis whose passengers also were turned away by Cuba and forced to return to Europe
``It was truly an incredible incredible historic event and suddenly _ boom
The Army Corps of Engineers said the Ostwind must be moved or cut to pieces by June 22
