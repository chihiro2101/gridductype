Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the Texas-Mexico border
At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800000 left homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mph wind earlier this week then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico
But by this morning the once massive storm's maximum sustained winds had flagged to 65 mph nine less than hurricane strength and forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared
Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 am EDT as it proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico said Noel Rishnychok a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables Fla
``What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history appears to have missed us''
At least a dozen tornadoes peppered southern Texas today following 14 on Friday killing one woman striking a hospital complex military bases and a mobile home park authorities said
At 6 am CDT the center of the storm was in northern Mexico near latitude 250 degrees north and longitude 998 west or about 150 miles southwest of Brownsville located at the southernmost tip of Texas
Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande valley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a ``huge rain-making machine'' said Mark Zimmer meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables Fla
Gilbert responsible for billions of dollars in damage during a weeklong rampage across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico barreled ashore Friday afternoon in Tamaulipas state a sparsely populated area of Mexico about 120 miles south of Brownsville
To the south about 300000 people were homeless in Yucatan state and 10000 more were homeless in Campeche on the west coast of the peninsula the government news agency Notimex said
About 125 shelters holding 50000 people were open in a four-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville said American Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman
