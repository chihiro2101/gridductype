An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds the government said and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment
The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from the US National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic could face ecological disaster if the 250000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill
Tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel which was 600 miles south of Cape Horn the tip of South America
The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 pm the government news agency Telam said citing a navy communique
The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula the National Science Foundation said in a statement released in Washington
The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station a US research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula the continent's tip
Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank that the leak which was threatening penguins and other wildlife had stopped
