Thousands of coastal residents from Mexico to Louisiana fled to higher ground Thursday as fierce Hurricane Gilbert sent the first of its storms against Texas after thrashing the Yucatan Peninsula
``This is a killer storm'' said Gordon Guthrie director of the Florida Division of Emergency of Management
``I feel sorry for anybody wherever this hits''
The death toll from the storm's onslaught through the Caribbean islands and the Yucatan was at least 47 and damage estimates reached $8 billion
The weather service issued a hurricane warning for Mexico's northern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coast from Brownsville to Port O'Connor including 250000-resident Corpus Christi
A hurricane watch remained in effect for the remainder of the Texas coast from Port O'Connor north to Port Arthur near the Louisiana border
The weather service said warnings might be extended northward depending on the path of the 450-mile wide storm
Texas Gov Bill Clements sent National Guard units to Alice McAllen and Corpus Christi the first such deployment for the hurricane to assist in communications and rescue duties
Grocery stores ran low on bottled water batteries canned tuna and bread as people laid in supplies
Offshore oil workers left their rigs in the Gulf of Mexico
``We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we are recommending evacuation of the island
We feel that we cannot wait until the morning to make that decision'' Matthews said adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45 to limit access to the island
In Brownsville Texas' southernmost city winds began to pick up around noon under overcast skies
But she added ``I could get along without a hurricane very well''
In the coastal resort of South Padre Island about 25 miles southeast of Brownsville the mayor ordered its 1000 residents to evacuate
``We can't force them to leave but it doesn't make any sense to stay'' said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr adding that water and electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon
The storm barreled into the Yucatan coast at dawn Wednesday thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves uprooting trees knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines
