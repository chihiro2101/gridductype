In the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a Bush Administration Cabinet nominee a prominent conservative told a Senate panel Tuesday that John Tower may lack the "moral character" to be secretary of defense
"Over the course of many years I have encountered the nominee in a condition -- lack of sobriety -- as well as with women to whom he was not married" conservative activist Paul M Weyrich told the Senate Armed Services Committee
"I encountered it frequently enough to the point where it made an impression" he added
Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to temper the panel's earlier praise for the former Texas senator
But several members conceded that while their former colleague may not be the ideal candidate for the Pentagon's top job he probably will win Senate approval anyway
Weyrich president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation testified that Tower's behavior makes him unfit to lead the Pentagon into an era of belt-tightening and management reform
Fulbright Institute scholar William C Jackson Jr and William G Phillips president of the Washington-based National Council for Industrial Defense joined Weyrich Tuesday in opposing Tower's nomination
Phillips echoed Jackson's complaint that Tower's lucrative ties to defense contractors and past support for big defense budgets raise "serious doubts that John Tower is the best man for the job
"I    wondered why the President of the United States chose John Tower for this job given the emphasis that he has placed on ethics and the appearance of wrongdoing" said Nebraska Sen James J Exon
