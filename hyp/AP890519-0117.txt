President Corazon Aquino on Friday refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said her government won't permit him to be buried here despite ``a last appeal'' from his wife
The 71-year-old Marcos was in critical condition Friday in a Honolulu hospital after emergency kidney surgery
Hospital officials said the ousted leader was suffering from renal cardiac and pulmonary failure
Marcos' wife Imelda broadcast an appeal Friday to Mrs Aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland and his supporters threatened mass protests if the request is rejected
But Mrs Aquino refused to withdraw her ban on Marcos and the Philippine Supreme Court rejected a petition from the former president's lawyer Juan David to order the return
Marcos has lived in Hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popular uprising that propelled Mrs Aquino to power
Maria Elena Cruz Mrs Aquino's daughter and personal secretary said the president received no calls from Mrs Marcos
Marcos supporters meanwhile announced they would hold rallies Saturday to pray for his recovery
