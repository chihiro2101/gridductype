Florence Griffith Joyner twice smashed a world record Thursday as she blazed to a gold medal in the 200-meter sprint
In that race she ran 2156 eclipsing the 9-year-old mark of 2171 set in 1979 by Marita Koch of East Germany and equaled three times since
Griffith Joyner who set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the 100 meters had a big lead Thursday as she turned the curve for the final 100 meters
Noted for her long painted fingernails and racy colorful bodysuits Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles has a chance to match the 1984 quadruple gold medal performance of US sprinter and long jumper Carl Lewis and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948
