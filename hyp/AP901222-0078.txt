Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery recalls waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to the USS Saratoga and joking ``Whoa looks like we're flooding''
Only minutes later his words came true turning a simple ride back from Christmas shore leave into a harrowing fight to survive
The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on Saturday throwing more than 100 men into the cold waters of Haifa Bay
At least 19 sailors drowned and scores were injured
The sailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq
Vickery 33 was among four American sailors interviewed at Haifa's Rambam Hospital
``And it was maybe two seconds and the boat rolled right over''
``As we were going on the waves I just noticed one that was bigger than normal and then another one that was bigger than normal'' he said
Benjamin said he dove from the ferry then had to swim frantically to get away from the suction of the sinking boat
``I was trying to get out of the way but I got hit by the ship''
Dazed Benjamin stripped off his jacket shirt and shoes and kept treading water until he found a piece of driftwood to cling to
Two other men interviewed at Rambam Hospital identified themselves as Technician John Richards 31 of Twin Lake Mich and Airman Lamont Jones 20 of Claremont Va
