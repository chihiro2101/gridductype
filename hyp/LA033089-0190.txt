As it was 10 different movies split 17 awards the most winners for one year in this decade
Rain Man" did win the grand prize (and three other big ones) and "Mississippi Burning" with just one Oscar for cinematography did get punished for its highly publicized historical muddling

David Grusin's Oscar for scoring "The Milagro Beanfield War" overcame even bigger odds winning over popular John Williams' score for "The Accidental Tourist"
