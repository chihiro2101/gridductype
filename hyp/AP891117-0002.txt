Federal aid was approved Friday for tornado-ravaged Huntsville where 17 died and several hundred were injured or lost their homes and Gov Guy Hunt toured hospitals and visited with grieving families
``I've been around a lot of tornadoes but I've not seen the type of damage on as broad a scale as I've seen this morning''
Hunt said after a helicopter tour of the 10-mile-long path of destruction
State emergency management officials estimated the damage in excess of $100 million in the agency's letter to President Bush requesting a disaster declaration said Terry Abbott the governor's press secretary
He listed 119 houses destroyed 125 with minor damage and three churches two schools 35 businesses and 10 public buildings either destroyed or suffering heavy damage
Wind in the tornado was estimated at 250 mph when the twister hit Wednesday afternoon
More than 400 people were injured with about 80 still under care in hospitals when Hunt visited patients' rooms Friday
Hunt asked that flags around the state be lowered to half-staff through Tuesday in memory of the victims and Marilyn Quayle wife of the vice president planned to visit the battered city Saturday
Grant Peterson associate director of the federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday he hopes that offices can be opened Sunday to take applications for disaster relief
