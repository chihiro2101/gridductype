Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case
And they said some children may have merely repeated stories told them by their parents and interviewers at Children's Institute International
``The CII interviews _ I could not accept them'' Mrs Williams said
But at CII I could not tell if the children were saying what was told to them (by interviewers) or if they were repeating what their parents had told them
They gave me a lot of reasonable doubt'' agreed juror Julie Peters 47 a supermarket meat wrapper
Equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by the Manhattan Beach Police Department to parents of McMartin school children
``The police letter should never have been sent'' said juror Sally Cordova 27 a supermarket checker
At that point jurors said they felt parents had been programmed to believe their children had been molested
``We just dismissed those'' said Mrs Williams
Some said they were unsure whether Buckey was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt
``Even if you accept that the children were molested'' said juror Mark Bassett ``the evidence didn't establish that they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School''
``I think everybody is a victim'' said Ms Peters
``I don't think anybody came out of this case a winner
There's nothing I can say that will make it better''
``There were days when I thought I couldn't stand it anymore
