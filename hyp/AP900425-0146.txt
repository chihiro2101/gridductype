Discovery's astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe
The $15 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 973 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the atmosphere which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes
The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's instruments
``So we have good news'' said Dave Drachlis of the Hubble control center
``Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly on its own'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said
Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put on spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed
Earlier this morning Discovery commander Loren J Shriver maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position with its nose pointed toward the sun
The five astronauts' busy day began on a musical note early this morning as Mission Control played a song called ``Space is Our World'' written by members of Discovery's training team and a Houston-area group Private Numbers
Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard Hubble the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built
