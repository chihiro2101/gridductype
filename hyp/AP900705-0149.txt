A natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack according to a study published in the journal Science
In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta
``TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack'' said Dr Allan M Lefer a professor at Jefferson
Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts
Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances such as tumor necrosis factor that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack
