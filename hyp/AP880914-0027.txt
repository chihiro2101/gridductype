With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour US weather officials called Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere
Mark Zimmer a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at Gilbert's center at 2613 inches at 552 pm EDT on Tuesday
``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere'' Zimmer said
The previous record low pressure of 2635 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph killing 408 people he said
With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's center Gilbert also was one of the largest
Hurricane Debby which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month was probably about half that size Moore said
