A drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients according to a study published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine
Surprisingly however the study found that the drug diltiazem increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally experts said
Even so the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug which is now primarily used to treat angina doctors said
The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack said Dr Arthur Moss a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study
But the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack
Dr John Schroeder a cardiologist and professor at Stanford University said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher
Dr George Beller a cardiologist and professor at the University of Virginia said he was also somewhat surprised about the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary congestion
