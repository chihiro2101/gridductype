Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time
``Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish'' said Lennard Fisk head of NASA science activities
More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight
The $15 billion telescope NASA's costliest cargo will give astronomers ``a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have'' said William Lenoir head of NASA's space flight program
Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere
Columbia which journeys into space next month with the Astro observatory sat on a launch pad 16 miles from Discovery only the second time both pads have been occupied the first was in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion
Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983 delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident
The latest postponement occurred April 10 when Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle
The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families
Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops
