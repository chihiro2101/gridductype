Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator but the dream faded overnight
Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket
Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration
The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy
