Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators embraced warmly Tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border dispute sources said
Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed 100000 troops on Kuwait's border
Gulf-based diplomatic sources said the Iraqi force triple the number earlier reported included about 300 Soviet-made tanks and dwarfed the entire Kuwaiti army of 20000 troops
The diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said the troops have been concentrated along the border since last week when Iraq began threatening Kuwait
Iraq accused the small Persian Gulf state of stealing oil from a disputed border region and forcing oil prices to drop
The delegation leaders Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah of Kuwait and Izzat Ibrahim deputy chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council met privately for two hours
The Iraq-Kuwait crisis broke out on July 17 when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of driving down oil prices by exceeding quotas set for them by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
Saddam also demanded compensation for the $24 billion in oil he claimed Kuwait pumped illegally from an oil field which straddles the unmarked border between the two countries
