An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease researchers said today
The surgery called a partial ileal bypass has one significant drawback
It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years
Dr Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota who directed the study said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment
The study was conducted in Minneapolis Los Angeles Philadelphia and Little Rock Ark and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine
Although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks Buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question
``It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid (cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered'' Buchwald said
