Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Thursday accused India of waging ``genocide'' in secession-minded Kashmir and of trying to start a war with Pakistan to deflect attention
Her remarks raised tensions further between India and Pakistan which have been feuding over Indian-controlled Kashmir
The two countries which have fought wars over the area in 1949 and 1965 have in recent weeks again built up their military forces near the common border
``India is indulging in genocide'' Ms Bhutto said at a news conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight Moslem countries in the Middle East and North Africa
She was referring to the assassination of Maulvi Mohammad Farooq the top Moslem cleric in Indian Kashmir
Ms Bhutto returned late Wednesday from visits to Iran Turkey Syria Jordan North Yemen Egypt Libya and Tunisia a high-profile diplomatic offensive to drum up support for Pakistan's stand on the Kashmir issue
During her trip abroad Ms Bhutto said all her host countries agreed that India and Pakistan needed to find a lasting political settlement of the 43-year-old dispute
