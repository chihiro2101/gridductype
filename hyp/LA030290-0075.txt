Try to think of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon less as a "happening" which it surely is or a world-class athletic event which it may become but is not now

It may not be an overstatement that the L A Marathon is one of the country's best-marketed sports events of any kind
Depending on your point of view this may or may not be good news
