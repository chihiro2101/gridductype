Lucille Ball the leggy showgirl model and B-grade movie queen whose pumpkin hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television died early Wednesday a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery
Hospital spokesman Ronald Wise said the rupture occurred in a portion of the aorta the main heart artery far from where the operation was performed
"There was nothing to indicate this would happen" Wise said
From her star-struck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the 1930s and '40s to the television career that made her a legend Miss Ball's life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches
Almost humbly she liked to say she owed her enormous success not so much to talent but to a magical combination of guts and good supporting players
"I am not funny" Ball told an interviewer for Rolling Stone magazine in 1983
I have never been scared
It was "I Love Lucy" which premiered on CBS on Oct 15 1951 that earned Miss Ball her niche in television history
In creating the show Miss Ball and Arnaz -- who died in 1986 -- set a pattern of television that was to be repeated in decades to come
The show was so popular during the 1950s that it literally stopped the nation every Monday night from 9 pm to 930 pm
" When presidential candidate Adlai E Stevenson interrupted the show once for a political message he was flooded with angry mail
Even a charge that Miss Ball was a Communist made by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952 failed to dent her popularity
The charges based on her registering to vote as a Communist in 1936 were dropped when Miss Ball explained she had done so only to please her ailing grandfather
Then there was the time she threw in two packages of yeast while baking homemade bread and ended up pinned against the wall of her Manhattan kitchen by a monster loaf
Week after week Lucy would find herself trapped in a vat of laundry starch locked in a meat freezer or lost on a subway with a loving cup stuck on her head
In its Lucy cover story Time magazine said "This is the sort of cheerful rowdiness that has been rare
In a 1981 interview in The Times even Miss Ball admitted "I love Lucy"
An amazing 44 million viewers 90% of the television audience gleefully watched on Jan 19 1953 when she gave birth on film to the show's little Ricky
To the unabashed delight of a nation it was the same night she had given birth in real life
"I loved doing all those pregnant shows"
In fact when she was a plucky 15-year-old looking for that first break on Broadway Miss Ball was told by a drama teacher to give up
Leaving school at 15 Miss Ball finally made it to New York and the John Murray Anderson dramatic school
There was a brief stint in a Ziegfeld Follies road show and some short-lived appearances in a handful of Broadway chorus lines
Diane and I was driving past the Belmont race track and the names seemed to fit together")
" She was described in one newspaper as a "slangy breezy wisecracking gal with a bebop rhythm to her walk"
With Arnaz traveling the country with his band and Miss Ball committed to Hollywood sound stages the pair spent almost $30000 on telegrams and long-distance telephone calls
"You can't have a marriage over the phone
What was done to salvage the marriage was "I Love Lucy"
"I wanted our characters to have problems" Miss Ball said of her concept for the show
And I wanted my husband to love me
but he never told me about it
I felt we could save the films for home movies   "
He drank and he gambled and he went around with other women
Breaking with the past Miss Ball left Hollywood for New York and a starring role in the musical "Wildcat"
"When she was running Desilu" he said "she made decisions affecting the future of the company that often amazed board members not because they were coming from a woman but because time usually proved her judgment to be correct"
With her children's careers off the launching pad the comedienne then 63 decided it was time to retire her legendary character "
The Lucy character is too old to run around like an idiot" she said in explanation
Although by now the world's best-known television star as a movie star Miss Ball again received mixed reviews
Her last flirtation with television came with her ill-fated and short-lived 1986 series "Life With Lucy" in which she again teamed with longtime sidekick Gale Gordon
Their struggles and early failed marriages seemed not to matter
While she always spoke fondly of Arnaz Miss Ball claimed that she had found the perfect mate in Morton
"He (Morton) takes care of me like I was his mother" she told an interviewer in 1981
On a scale of 1 to 10 Miss Ball said "I rate my marriage to Gary a 12"
But to her countless television fans -- from the postwar babies who adored her during the '50s to their children and children's children who roared at her antics through decades of reruns -- it was always Lucy and Ricky
There was always the hilarious image of the redhead and "that Cuban bongo player" as Miss Ball affectionately called him
Even years after the Lucy shows ended the comedienne openly admitted to missing the characterization
"After Lucy ended I thought 'I'll live a few more years and then I'll die" she said in 1983
