British Prime Minister John Major said today that Iraqi troops will have to be "forcibly removed" from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to withdraw them peacefully
Major just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor Margaret Thatcher rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis
"A complete withdrawal is necessary a partial withdrawal won't do" Major said in a display of solidarity with US policy on the Persian Gulf
On the gulf issue at least Major's remarks augured well for his talks with President Bush late in the day at Camp David the Maryland presidential retreat where the two leaders were planning an overnight stay
