Port workers in Szczecin and southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity opposition activists said
In support of an estimated 3000 colleagues striking for a second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie workers at the nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and launched their own occupation strike
Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin about 250 miles northwest of Warsaw and set up a 15-member strike committee said Jan Kostecki a leader of the independent union federation
Andrzej Andrzejczak head of the Morcinek mine strike committee said ``We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine workers''
The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto where strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent labor federation pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for trade union activites
Andrzejczak said the Morcinek miners broke off talks with management when they were refused access to loudspeakers and contact with the strikers at July Manifesto
It was not immediately known how many workers were involved
Police surrounded the mine after workers put down their tools on Tuesday
Miners leaving July Manifesto this morning said wage demands were based on hardships caused by Poland's worsening economy including 60 percent inflation
Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said there were no reports of violence and police made no attempt to move into the mine which is 280 miles southwest of Warsaw and employs about 9000 workers
Also Tuesday security officials briefly detained 10 Solidarity activists at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw in lower Silesia
