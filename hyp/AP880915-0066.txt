A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ``totally fiction''
Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast
``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license
The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon'' which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife
Ono refuted virtually all of these charges and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes
``It's totally fiction'' Yoko said during the hour-long program which opened with Lennon's song ``Gimme Some Truth'' and coincided with the book's national release Wednesday
The Ono interview was taped Aug 28 at the Dakota where the Lennons lived _ and Yoko still lives with their son Sean
She denied that Lennon was homosexual that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota with his son Sean that he had become a reclusive rock 'n' roll Howard Hughes
