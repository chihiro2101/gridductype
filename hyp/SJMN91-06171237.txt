The women's field for Sunday's San Francisco Marathon appears mighty impressive to race President Rich Nichols who didn't have to do much coaxing to get the highly ranked women to enter
"This year's women's field is interesting because most of the competitors called us" said Nichols
The Olympic trials scheduled for January have made Nichols' job much easier this year
Most top-ranked US women are looking for any summer-time marathon in which to run and the San Francisco version offers excellent conditions
Last year's winner Janis Klecker of Minnetonka Minn is entered
The field also boasts Janine Aiello of Albuquerque NM
Julie Shea-Graw of Raleigh NC and Jane Welzel of Fort Collins Colo
She was the top qualifier for the 1980 Olympics team that missed the Moscow Summer Games because of a US boycott
