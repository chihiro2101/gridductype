Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25000 people dead in northern Iran
The country has endured several massive tragedies in recent years
An estimated 1 million Iranians were killed or wounded in the eight-year war with Iraq that ended in 1988
About 25000 people died in eastern Iran in a 1978 earthquake
Within half an hour the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the tremor had been felt in Tehran the capital
The only detail reported for hours was that when the quake hit Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between Brazil and Scotland
While IRNA reported 10000 dead late Thursday the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations said 25000 people had died
