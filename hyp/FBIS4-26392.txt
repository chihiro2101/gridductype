[Text] Beijing 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters after the largest or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China occurred a few days ago in the Xi Jiang Bei Jiang Xiang Jiang and Gan Jiang rivers water levels in these rivers are dropping slowly however high water levels will remain in these rivers for the next few days
The flood water in Guangdong's Xi Jiang crested in Gaoyao County on 20 June the water level in Gaoyao's Xi Jiang dropped to 1337 meters at 0600 today
Drops in water levels in Guangdong's Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang do not mean that Guangdong's flooding situations have eased because flood waters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea after the two flood waters jointly flow through the low-lying Zhujiang Delta
With these factors combined the Zhujiang Delta which has a developed economy and a forest of factories will face the most rigorous flood water test since the liberation of the country
The flood peak passed Changsha on 19 June but the water level at the Changsha Station was still at 25 meters at 0200 today [1800 GMT 20 June]
