Rep Larry Combest R-Texas issued a terse statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting
An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen Sam Nunn the committee chairman ``like a ton of bricks'' and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination
The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI saying that Tower and a group of friends _ not Tower alone _ had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch
The Washington Post reported that Combest described for Nunn and Sen John W Warner of Virginia the ranking Republican on the committee Tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s
A congressional source was quoted as saying that Combest told the senators that Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week
Trudi Boyd Combest's administrative assistant told the Post that Combest originally went to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol
