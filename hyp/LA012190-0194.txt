Geraldo Rivera was interviewing Peggy Ann Buckey on TV
Abby Mann watched listened -- and saw the makings of a movie
Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey one of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case
In that 1986 interview Peggy Buckey was "quite eloquent" in arguing that charges against her brother Ray and mother Peggy McMartin Buckey should be dropped as well Mann recalled Friday
Mann an Oscar- and Emmy-winning screenwriter and producer recognized a theme he had tapped before the hysteria of a witch hunt
Soon Mann became a controversial figure in the case itself -- but he got the inside track on movie and book deals
At least two other books are planned and at least one prominent television movie producer besides Mann says he is developing a McMartin project
That producer who requested anonymity said he is certain other producers are considering projects as well
"It's definitely a TV thing" one agent said
The producer chases down participants gets rights -- and then it's an easy sale to networks"
"None of the three networks would touch Ray Buckey's story" predicted Steven White an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both NBC and ABC
Producers think network qualms can be overcome however
Though no explicit McMartin story was produced child abuse and molestation was a recurring subject
Outraged parents suggested the real aim was a not-guilty verdict which would improve the value of Mann's movie deal
Times staff writer Lois Timnick who covered the case from its early stages through the trial also is planning a book
