A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts a coast guard spokesman said
The ship sank at about 1245 pm in high winds some 28 nautical miles north of the island of Ameland
It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland according to the coast guard spokesman who was not identified
Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany
