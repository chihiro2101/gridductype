While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind roared outside Mayor Joseph P Riley Jr watched the fury it vented on his beloved 300-year-old city
Riley city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's historic City Hall through Thursday night as the area's worst hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the Civil War began
Late in the day there was hope Hugo might spare Charleston
From the moment it became apparent Hugo might strike the Southeast coast many Charlestonians conceded that this time their number was up
During it all Riley kept in close contact with the National Weather Service
As the eye of the storm passed he took reporters onto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at the damage
