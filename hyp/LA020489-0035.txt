In its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee John Tower the FBI is checking allegations that Tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness sources said Friday -- allegations that call into question his insistence that he has no current drinking problem
Tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier this week that his problems with alcohol are behind him
But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee who asked not to be identified said Friday that the new allegation if true suggests that the former Texas senator's drinking problem "may be ongoing" and that his confirmation remains in doubt
The charge received Wednesday by the committee was very specific giving the date and place of the alleged incident and was made by an informant who identified herself a knowledgeable source said
If the new charges should be verified by the FBI Tower's nomination is doomed an authoritative committee source said
But one source said that no one on the staff contradicted Tower's statement that in recent years he has moderated his once-heavy drinking and now drinks only an occasional glass of wine
In fact in recent weeks the staff told agents he often has ordered tonic water
None of the staff could recall any recent incident of improper behavior by Tower at the restaurant sources said
On Thursday the Armed Services Committee had been set to approve the Tower nomination but Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga) abruptly canceled the vote because of the new charges which he referred immediately to FBI Director William S Sessions
A senior White House staff member who asked not to be identified said Administration officials were getting impatient with the delays in Tower's confirmation
