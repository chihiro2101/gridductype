Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches
``I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers'' said Milica Nikolic a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac
People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers french fries milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West
It also featured amber-colored tables and floors pastel-colored upholstery modern art paintings and discreet illumination
The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonald's in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica ground pork and onions on a bun
``In fact this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica'' said Vesna Milosevic an official of Genex a Yugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with McDonald's
``Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslav market'' said Predrag Dostanic managing director of the Genex-McDonald's
Sadik Seljami a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a few hundred yards from the McDonald's suggested that the American restaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out of business
