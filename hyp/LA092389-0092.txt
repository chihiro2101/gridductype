The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble killing 10 people and injuring 22 eight seriously
It would be one of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island
A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb
But he said the characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared to confirm that it was the work of the IRA
Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA "active service" units each composed of four or five members are operating in Britain and continental Europe
One member known as the "Jackal" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth novel "The Day of the Jackal" has been eluding the authorities for two years
He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in August 1988
Sheehy and another wanted Irishman John Conaghty were linked to an IRA bomb factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in pursuit of a car thief
A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons ammunition 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a "hit list" of 100 British political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
"I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode" Heather Hackett a 26-year-old Deal housewife told the British Press Assn
The authorities have been on high alert expecting IRA attacks in connection with last month's 20th anniversary of the introduction of British troops into Northern Ireland
But in a statement telephoned to a Dublin news agency Ireland International Friday's attack was linked to Thatcher's visit last week to units of the controversial Ulster Defense Regiment in Northern Ireland
The locally recruited overwhelmingly Protestant Ulster Defense Regiment has come under fire in connection with an investigation into the leak of secret government lists of suspected IRA members to Protestant assassination squads
