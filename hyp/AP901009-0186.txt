John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was delivered Tuesday as his song ``Imagine'' was played simultaneously for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday
``A dream we dream alone is only a dream but the dream we dream together is reality
The world is better today for sharing a time with you''
Yoko Ono said at a United Nations ceremony before the playing of ``Imagine''
The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a taped message that served as an introduction to the music
``We all want peace whatever sort of job we have
War or peace'' said Lennon whose son Sean turned 15 Tuesday
The song originally on the ``White Album'' was the first Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in 1969
Other observances were held from Liverpool to Moscow to Los Angeles
Ono was greeted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar wife of the UN secretary-general
US Armed Forces television and radio beamed it to 80-plus other countries
