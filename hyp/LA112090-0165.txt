Flamboyant former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine's challenge to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative Party has caused a political sensation in Britain
A crucial first vote of Tory Members of Parliament (MPs) is scheduled for today and if Heseltine should wrest control of the party from Thatcher -- the longest-serving British head of government in modern times -- she would also have to give up the prime minister's job that she has held since 1979
Here's a sampling of editorial comment on the contest that has stirred Britain
The coup de grace may not be delivered at this moment
The nature of the era that comes afterward is far from clear
"The party may sullenly support her now but they will ask the question again in the spring knowing that if they do not do so the country will ask the same question even more pitilessly when the general election comes
It is to acknowledge that an era has passed and preserve its achievements by standing down releasing her lieutenants and urging her party in the interests of a vanished unity to support Mr (Foreign Minister Douglas)
"It would be foolish to deny that today the prime minister is politically beleaguered as never before
from watching the prime minister answer questions in the Commons that she was fighting for her life
"British Conservative MPs must be prepared to reject Mrs Thatcher when they vote in the party's leadership election
It is no longer in the interests of the United Kingdom which are now inextricably linked with the development of a strong and united Europe for her to remain in office
Apart from her domestic achievements in reviving the British economy in the 1980s Mrs Thatcher has contributed much more to the development of the European Community than she is often given credit for
"But The European believes that her nightmare vision of Europe of ill-intentioned people trying to destroy democracy is not shared by most of the British people
Either it will reelect Mrs Thatcher and see the United Kingdom slip into isolation as it is left behind the rest of the Community
"A prime minister in total command for 11 years could not be unseated and cherished policies abandoned without an explosion within the party
But what they are proposing to do to Mrs Thatcher unquestionably the greatest peacetime prime minister of this century is quite simply unworthy
These plotters would like to dispatch Mrs Thatcher who almost single-handedly has won three elections by the political equivalent of the rope
