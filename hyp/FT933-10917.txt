THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised some people
With luck it is reckoned Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction
Fifteen months too late the voters of Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury
In reality all politicians not just Major are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public
In public they have to be careful of what they say so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness
To show you what I mean I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith
Smith a Scot is leader of the Labour Party though not many people know that
To guarantee them privacy I used a signal-scrambler
No one could have eavesdropped
But I have left out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged
You are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century
Gie me o'wit an' sense a life behint a kist to lie an' sklent
Likewise with political and constitutional reform Michael for by the L - - d tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow I'll laugh
After that I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown leader of the Liberal Democrats to solicit his views on Christchurch
