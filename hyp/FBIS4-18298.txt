[Colin Brown article "Cabinet Allies Close Ranks
[Text] Cabinet ministers rallied behind John Major yesterday by insisting there would be no leadership election this autumn
But the concerted show of support failed to dispel doubts among Tory MPs about his chances of staying in office
Right-wing MPs confirmed the findings in an INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY/NOP [National Opinion Poll] poll that Michael Heseltine was the favourite to replace Mr Major if he is forced out
But they are calculating that Michael Portillo will run hard to secure Eurosceptic policies from the eventual winner
That message was reinforced by three Cabinet ministers who broke their Easter Sundays to support Mr Major
Michael Howard the Home Secretary said "There is no prospect of any leadership contest
John Major is going to lead the Conservative Party successfully into the next general election"
However Tory right wingers said last night that they would support Mr Major because there was no credible right-wing candidate
The Prime Minister told journalists at his Huntingdon Conservative Club at the weekend that he would not be forced out by the speculation
