``I believe in fairies the myths dragons
It all exists even if it's in your mind
Who's to say that dreams and nightmares aren't as real as the here and now
Reality leaves a lot to the imagination''
Watching the new movie ``Imagine John Lennon'' was very painful for the late Beatle's wife Yoko Ono
``What John was really about is depicted in this film very accurately and without whitewashing
In the sense you had to put a 40-year life into an hour and a half balance is a very serious consideration
I think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so''
There is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by Lennon tied in with the film and using the same title
``We were naive'' Ono said
To us Al Capp was just a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal with a sense of humor
``Al Capp is one incident that was filmed
Each time I think we were hurt''
I think it's one of the songs that will really go on forever in people's minds''
She later joined him in music and in public demonstrations for peace
Since then she's received a tremendous amount of support from friends and fans
``I was very touched and thankful that people sent letters to me and extended hands at this time very warmly
She has no idea how many books have been written about Lennon she's been sent some of them but hasn't read them
There's still enough footage Ono said for another movie _ perhaps a music or political or art film
The songs might be strung together
They might become a record might eventually become a musical
There are enough finished songs
