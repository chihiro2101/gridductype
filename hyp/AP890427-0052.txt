As a young girl in western New York Lucille Ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as she dreamed of starring in movies hometown friends recalled
``She always talked about being a star'' said Pauline Lopus who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her
Miss Ball born 60 miles south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug 6 1911 grew up in nearby Celoron a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake
Mrs Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as ``daring in many ways''
At 15 Miss Ball worked as a barker at the amusement park screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice
Although Miss Ball hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had no family there she stayed in touch with friends
Miss Ball regularly donated money to charities civic events and Jamestown Community College said Jamestown Mayor Steven Carlson
After Miss Ball suffered a heart attack last week residents decided to sign the posters and send them to her as a get-well greeting
