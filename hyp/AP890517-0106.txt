The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F Secchia as ambassador to Italy but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might ``embarrass the United States'' because of his ``penchant for making gross remarks''
The committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of Secchia a former Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry executive
The chairman Sen Claiborne Pell D-RI and Sen Alan Cranston D-Calif voted ``present'' meaning they took no position
Pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts ``containing the distasteful specifics of Mr Secchia's remarks''
