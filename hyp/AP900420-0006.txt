President Bush is expected to name a female career diplomat as US ambassador to Nicaragua as that country prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro according to informed sources
The sources said Thursday it is virtually certain the appointment will go to Melissa Wells 57 currently ambassador to Mozambique
They said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to Mrs Chamorro who takes office Wednesday
Ms Wells who was born in Estonia has no prior experience in Latin America
Wells' name was submitted to the White House by Secretary of State James A Baker III for the Managua post and approval is considered ``999 percent certain'' one source said
But a new era in US-Nicaraguan relations is expected to open with the inauguration of Mrs Chamorro who defeated President Daniel Ortega in elections this February
