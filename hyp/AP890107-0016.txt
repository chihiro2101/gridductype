TOKYO (AP _ Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign Japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific conflict in World War II
Shortly after that decision and for most of his reign Hirohito became a figurehead isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love the study of marine biology
He was the last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era
But in his first 20 years the ``Son of Heaven'' was worshiped as a divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu
The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so intrigued Hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who became the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of 25 on Christmas Day 1926 designating his reign ``Showa'' _ ``enlightened peace''
``Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is burdened''
Then evoking a memory of his grandfather the Emperor Meiji whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese isolation from the outside world Hirohito told the officers
In a national radio broadcast Aug 15 _ the first time ordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice _ he personally announced the decision to surrender
He told the ravaged nation that ``the war situation has developed not necessarily to our advantage''
Three weeks later Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat striped trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander Gen Douglas A MacArthur at the US Embassy in Tokyo
He possessed rare collections of marine life discovered several species himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books on hydrozoa or sea animals his specialty
Still Hirohito and the imperial system remained important to Japan
A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in March 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2184 people polled supported the imperial system while only 11 percent said it should be abolished
The Imperial Household Agency which ran his affairs said Hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling times of his life in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery from a war that cost 31 million Japanese lives
Despite the humanization of the Imperial family Hirohito remained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency
