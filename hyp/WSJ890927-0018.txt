Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately analysts and company officials say
The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group a trade association is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow
"Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record" said one official far surpassing the $7525 million insurers paid out after Frederick ripped through several Gulf Coast states in 1979
The impact on premium rates could be minimal for now analysts expect because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area -- for homes and autos
Yet some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months
For the time being the losses from Hugo "will be substantial but they won't be something the industry can't handle" said Charles L Ruoff director of strategic planning at Fred S James &amp Co a New York-based insurance broker
For instance State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co estimates it will pay claims totaling more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses
The company which is the largest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and No 3 in South Carolina has already received 16000 claims from the stricken region
Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp which has extensive domestic foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit and USF&ampG Corp in Baltimore a big insurer in the Carolina region could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings analysts said
Hugo could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at Travelers Corp Aetna Life &amp Casualty Insurance Co and Chubb Corp according to industry analysts
Niagara Exchange Corp based in Buffalo NY said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter and possibly for the year because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co unit faces as a result of the hurricane
