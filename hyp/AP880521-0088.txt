Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath the Aegean Sea and back into history finding a treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822
The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship according to Peter Nicolaides a diver and salvage expert
The Bourloti Seimaz _ or ``Explosives Invincible'' _ was set afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios
Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids which shocked other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire
The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture ``The Massacre of Chios'' based on the raids
``It's an incredible discovery straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the War of Independence'' Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press
American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A &amp M University working in cooperation with Turkish divers have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast
