Thousands of grieving friends and relatives of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS Iowa gathered quietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved ones as ``brothers in eternity''
``We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished and in fact for the 11 who survived'' the president told a packed memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station
``They all were in the words of a poet `the men behind the guns'
The president a World War II Navy pilot said he was proud to recommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle stars in two wars
But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesday in the battleship's No 2 gun turret he said ``Fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship''
Fred P Moosally said the turret's crew was the best gun crew on the ship and called its chief _ Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson NY
Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the 6000 people crowded into a hangar for the service
Many were angry they could not attend said Machinist's Mate David Finn 38
The men of Turret Two will be part of the spirit of the Iowa forever''
Bush recounted seeing the Iowa off the coast of the Philippines as a naval aviator in World War II and the great sense of confidence the big ship lent to the fleet
Addressing the children of the victims he said ``You must never forget that your father was America's pride''
At the end of the service while the Navy Hymn was played President and Mrs Bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men
``Besides the firefighting crews we had cooks engineers deck seamen Marines all fighting to save the ship''
Moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to Vice Adm Jerome Johnson commander of the 2nd Fleet to tell him to watch the No 2 turret because it contained his best crew
All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last Wednesday when the explosion ripped through it
John P Morse the Iowa's weapons officer said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident and Moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety
