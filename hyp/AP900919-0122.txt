East Germany's ousted secret police chief threatened to break former Communist leader Erich Honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail a West German newspaper reported Wednesday
82-year-old former security chief Erich Mielke shouted at Honecker according to Bild newspaper
Mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police known as Stasi which built up files on 6 million East Germans and kept a tight rein on the population
He is suspected of giving sanctuary to members of West Germany's leftist terrorist group the Red Army Faction and of setting up contacts between the group and Palestinian guerrillas
One prison warden told Bild that many of the guards had worked for Mielke's Stasi and that they might interpret his threat against Honecker as an order to kill the former Communist chief
