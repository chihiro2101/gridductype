One year after his election Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted He has become dull
His coming-out party last Sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news
This was no small thing
During his entire campaign for the vice presidency Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows
He didn't appear on "Meet the Press" or "This Week With David Brinkley" or "Face the Nation"
And he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news
He was the stuff of nightly TV monologues "
"We had asked him on the show a number of times" Christie Basham senior producer of "Meet the Press" told me "but he always declined
We renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show he changed his mind and said he would
It was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest"
And it says something about Dan Quayle's reputation that he would be considered "above and beyond" the usual guest
They don't run departments or make policy
Quayle answered all the questions put to him and he made little if any news
I asked David Beckwith his spokesman why Quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show
"And Marlin (Fitzwater Bush's spokesman) called and just suggested we do the show" Beckwith said
The selection of Dan Quayle had been Bush's first major (and some would say only) decision of his presidential campaign
And now was the time for Quayle to go on "Meet the Press" and show everybody just how right George Bush had been
I asked Beckwith if Quayle had been pleased by how the show had gone
Quayle's questioners were David Broder of the Washington Post and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker both of whom stuck to serious questions
