A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange India's largest stock market and the Securities and Exchange Board of India the securities watchdog over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books
The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments
In one of its most damaging passages the inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari a former BSE president and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal a member of the BSE's governing body avoided margin payments totalling Rs1854m (Pounds 408m)
Mr M R Mayya the BSE's executive director said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions
Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and others to dodge taxes and also contributed to last year's securities market scandal in which banks including the UK's Standard Chartered Bank lost a combined gross total of Rs40bn
