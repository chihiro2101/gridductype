McDonald's hamburgers fries and golden arches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened its first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine
Hundreds of Chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in Shenzhen an economic boom town near Hong Kong for their first taste of a McDonald's hamburger fries or shake
``I travelled for four hours from a village to get here'' said Huang Rongti 70 who has lost most of her teeth because of age
``You think hamburgers are too challenging for my age''
The opening of a US fast-food restaurant in China where cooking has long been considered a culinary art may seem odd to gourmets
However many Chinese who earn an average $32 a month are still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants
Another US fast food outlet Kentucky Fried Chicken opened a restaurant in Beijing in 1987 and it now has four outlets there
The 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in a three-story building is operated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong
