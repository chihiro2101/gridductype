The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen John Tower as defense secretary delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term
The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on Tower's drinking habits behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors
Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the roll call underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee
``The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed'' Quayle intoned after the vote
Kansas GOP Sen Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to declare her opposition
She said her ``most serious concerns'' were over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an arms control negotiator
She also expressed doubts that he would pay enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military
``Just moments ago I took a call from John Tower'' said Sen John Warner of Virginia the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee
``His head is high his voice is strong'' Warner said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell D-Maine moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate and President Bush
Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking
Senators from both parties credited Tower's defeat to the decision to oppose him made by Sen Sam Nunn D-Ga chairman of the Armed Services Committee
The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and one Republican committed to vote against Tower or leaning strongly in that direction
