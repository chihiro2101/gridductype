Soldiers from three nations locked the doors of Checkpoint Charlie today and a crane whisked away the Cold War relic that symbolized a divided world
The famed Allied checkpoint by the Berlin Wall was closed with an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from the Germanys and the four World War II Allies
``For 29 years Checkpoint Charlie embodied the Cold War'' US Secretary of State James A Baker III told a crowd of invited guests and journalists on Berlin's Friedrich Street
``And now 29 years after it was built we meet here today to dismantle it and to bury the conflicts it created''
Baker Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from France Britain and the two Germanys each heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change
The United States France and Great Britain have an estimated 12000 troops in West Berlin
The German and Allied foreign ministers are meeting in East Berlin to discuss the status of the city and a united Germany's role in world affairs
Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily and US officials decided to time the removal of Checkpoint Charlie with the foreign ministers' meeting
The ceremony was closed to the public but not to the residents of the buildings that line Friedrich Street which had been divided by the Berlin Wall since 1961
