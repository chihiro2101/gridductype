Forty years after Sam Walton first hung out his shingle Walton's 5&amp10 will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire
Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9 1950
The center chronicles the rise of the nation's fastest-growing discount chain using displays and audio-video presentations
The window displays date back to the store's opening with Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat a box of Dreft and some Ivory Snow
Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his ``dance on Wall Street'' which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984
The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of the nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp of Detroit
Aside from the other displays and presentations the center also has a replica of Sam Walton's original office at the store including many fixtures he used 40 years ago
Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton a fat-faced baby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s
Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle then a public health officer to take over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955
