Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has weakened her position and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plans to step down after winning another term opposition leaders and political observers said
A pro-Thatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated the obvious and that her statements were no ``cause for astonishment''
Mrs Thatcher told The Sunday Correspondent in an interview published Sunday that she hoped to lead her Conservative Party to a fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try for a fifth
The Sunday Times of London said in a commentary ``Mrs Thatcher has committed a colossal blunder''
``She has given the riders for the Tory succession their starting orders years in advance of the actual race'' the newspaper said
Mrs Thatcher who turned 64 last month has never previously made it clear in public when she plans to retire as party leader
Earlier this year Mrs Thatcher overtook Liberal Lord Asquith's 1908-1916 tenure as prime minister to become Britain's longest continuously serving prime minister of the 20th century
The newspaper predicted the opposition Labor Party will try to promote leader Neil Kinnock as ``the occupant-in-waiting of 10 Downing St who is ready able and willing to complete a full term''
