Though the historic McMartin Pre-School criminal trial finally has ended in acquittals a host of civil lawsuits generated by the Manhattan Beach molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for decades legal experts say
A confusing array of civil actions await resolution
These include a federal civil rights suit filed Friday by Peggy McMartin Buckey against her accusers and others a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station and reporter and suits the pre-school owners have filed against their liability insurance carriers
Also Ray Buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother said his attorney Scott Bernstein
And an attorney representing several parents of McMartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the pre-school for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children
"I'm convinced this case will never end" Eli Gauna who represents Babette Spitler a former teacher at the school said wearily
A decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled against Ray Buckey
The criminal case began in March 1984 when seven McMartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on 115 counts of molestation
Defendants included Buckey his mother his grandmother Virginia McMartin who was the school founder his sister Peggy Ann Buckey and teachers Spitler Betty Raidor and Mary Ann Jackson
Ira Reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing "incredibly weak evidence"
But those lawsuits later were withdrawn to prevent the children's psychiatric histories from being introduced as evidence in the criminal case
Greg Mooney an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs explained that during the criminal preliminary hearing defense attorneys had sought psychiatric records of the alleged victims
Defense attorneys argued that they should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their patient-therapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their psychiatric histories would be at issue
Many of the children who attended McMartin are now entering their early teens but the youngest of those who attended the school then is now 8 years old
In the so-called delayed-discovery theory a statute of limitations does not take effect until the victim actually becomes aware of molestation and some victims might suppress memories of such attacks for years
Whether the families would be willing to tackle more years of legal proceedings is yet to be seen
And some families question whether the McMartin defendants' insurance carriers would pay out to plaintiffs who successfully sued the school
"There is some sentiment that says 'Let's just put this behind us'
Said one McMartin attendee's parent who asked not to be identified "I might be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child
The McMartin side alleges that the insurance carriers were required by the policy to pay for their attorney bills
