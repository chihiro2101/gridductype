Writer Salman Rushdie who has been sentenced to die by Iranian zealots has donated $8600 to victims of last week's devastating earthquake in Iran
Rushdie donated the money to the Independent Iranian Earthquake Appeal organized by the Independent newspaper to help survivors of the earthquake that Iranian officials said left at least 50000 people dead
The Indian-born writer has been out of public view since Feb 14 1989 when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini sentenced him to death for writing "The Satanic Verses" a novel many Muslims regard as blasphemous
"The foreign media seems to think that by publishing news of aid from Salman Rushdie to earthquake victims we will compromise on Rushdie's fatwa (edict)" Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali known as the "Hanging Judge" said in Tehran
