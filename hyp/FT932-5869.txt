AS THE value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worry about a host of obstacles to investing in Russia Russian officials had several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for McDonald's hamburgers
Opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow along with a 12-storey office block Mr George Cohon head of McDonald's Canada could well be described as the Russian authorities' idea of a model investor
Mr Viktor Khlystun the agriculture minister praised the fact that McDonald's gets most of its supplies from inside Russia after setting up a Dollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow
But despite the jolly opening ceremony - with Big Macs musicians playing the balalaika and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant M - life has been tough for McDonald's since it opened its first restaurant in Moscow 3 1/2 years ago
