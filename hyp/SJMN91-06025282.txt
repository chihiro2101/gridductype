Henry Carley lives on the west side of town a couple of miles from Tampa Stadium
The last time the Super Bowl was played there in 1984 he felt as distant from all the hoopla as if he were 1000 miles away he recalls
Carley the president of the local chapter of the NAACP had no interest in being inside the stadium
He says he only wished the black community could have shared in some of the considerable profits generated by one of America's greatest sports events
"The Super Bowl is about money" Carley said last week
This year Carley is the co-chairman of one of the featured events of Super Bowl week the Bambaleo Parade a Saturday extravaganza with marching bands a street festival and floats
The grand marshal of the parade will be Lee Roy Selmon a former Tampa Bay Buccaneer
"There's much more involvement this time black and white" said Carley who is the affirmative-action officer for Hillsboro Community College
"The Super Bowl introduces you to the world in a big way" said Barbara Casey the coordinator of the Super Bowl Task Force
Last month NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would stand by his recommendation to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of Tempe Ariz because the state does not have a holiday honoring Dr Martin Luther King
The last time the Super Bowl was held in a cold-climate city was in 1982 when the 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals 26-21 in Pontiac Mich
