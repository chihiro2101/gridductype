Actor Gale Gordon a sidekick of Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny
``Oh but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face'' the 83-year-old Gordon said in a telephone interview
Gordon who is appearing in a play in Edmonton spent the day in an Edmonton hotel room mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend
In his first television series alongside Miss Ball Gordon was the flustered banker Mr Mooney in ``The Lucy Show'' from 1962-68
Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program ``My Favorite Husband'' which later became ``I Love Lucy'' on television
Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday Feb 20 when ``she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years''
