Three major new eruptions rocked Mount Pinatubo late Wednesday night and early today forcing another emergency evacuation of Clark Air Base and increasing fears of even more violent explosions from the long-dormant volcano in the days ahead
Mudslides also threatened after fierce thunderstorms and lightning Wednesday illuminated afternoon skies eerily darkened by giant volcanic clouds
As much as two inches of coarse gray ash and fist-sized pieces of pumice fell along a 50-mile stretch southwest of the volcano
An eruption this morning caused an earthquake so strong it "sent seismograph needles off the chart" and registered 60 miles south in Manila said Jessie Daligdig a government geologist
Villagers tied wet kerchiefs on their faces and used rakes shovels and pieces of wood to push the blanket of snow-like ash from roads
Two people have been reported killed so far a Filipino serving in the US Navy who died in a traffic accident on an ash-slick road and a Filipino boy reported to have died after inhaling sulfuric fumes that began to seep from the volcano last weekend
The initial explosions on Mount Pinatubo at 851 am Wednesday sent a 10-mile-high mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies over Clark Air Base forcing the Air Force to evacuate hundreds of American volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive communications equipment
US officials have refused to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at Clark but they denied news reports suggesting a radiation danger if weapons depots on the base were hit by molten rock
Philippine civil defense officials said that they had evacuated 19369 people from villages within a 12-mile radius of the volcano by late Wednesday
