The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $15 billion instrument
``You've been released from Hubble support it's on its own'' Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened
``Thank you sir that's great news'' said Discovery Commander Loren J Shriver
``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here'' said Steve Hawley who had been at the controls when the telescope was released into its own orbit on Wednesday
``I'll bet it's just that way down there too''
The successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the astronauts to return to Earth on Sunday
They had blasted into space Tuesday after a two-week delay and dispatched the telescope from its payload bay Wednesday
``The Hubble is open for business'' Mission Control told the astronauts
The telescope still was having problems however
``We've got a very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the usefulness
NASA announced that ``at this time the telescope is safe stable''
The inside is painted black to absorb stray light
If the door opening command had failed the five Discovery astronauts who deployed Hubble were prepared to head back to the telescope
The astronauts were awakened at 230 am EDT to the mellow sounds of the Beach Boys' song ``Kokomo''
