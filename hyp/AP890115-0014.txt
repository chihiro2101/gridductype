Deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade but it remains by far the nation's biggest killer taking a life every 32 seconds the American Heart Association said Sunday
``The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the death rate from the biggest killer of our population'' said Dr Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who is president of the heart association
The association released the statistics at its annual forum for science writers
Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of healthier living habits including fewer cigarettes and better food and improved medical treatment
``The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past 20 years'' said Dr Myron L Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University
There is almost no form of heart disease that we can't approach without meaningful treatment''
``I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic heart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stop smoking get cholesterol treated if it's above 220 and identify and treat hypertension'' he said
Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978500 Americans died from heart attacks strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels
Cancer the No 2 killer took 466000 lives
