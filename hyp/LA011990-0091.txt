Ray Buckey and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey were found not guilty Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history
Ray Buckey 31 left the courtroom without comment -- free on his own recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will retry him on the 13 undecided counts
and now we've lost everything" she said outside the court
"My concern was for my son and what they've done to him    because my son would never harm a child"
The Buckeys who spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system had sat silently staring straight ahead as the jury filed into the room shortly before 1030 am and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in anticipation
"All the verdicts are the same" said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders handing them to his court clerk
At first the defendants remained stoic then their eyes began to rim with tears
"I knew God would set my son and me free because we have done nothing" she said as she was driven away
"I held his hand" Buckey's mother said after the verdicts were announced "and I told him 'I told you Ray' and he felt like he wanted to cry
The acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history a case that stemmed from a 2 1/2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that he had been sodomized at his school by a "Mr Ray"
It was very difficult to find corroboration in this case"
Asked if the case was worth its cost in money lives and stress Pounders said he thinks society benefited from the case
"No matter what the jury says whatever anybody says this is the truth
Another of the children said that when the clerk read "not guilty" on the verdict form "my stomach just hollowed out
In particular they cited the prosecution's reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of the young witnesses at a Los Angeles child-abuse center
They also criticized the Manhattan Beach Police Department's decision early in the investigation to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and soliciting information
That's the main crux of it"
These counts involve 12 molestation charges against Ray Buckey and a conspiracy count that accused both him and his mother
"The system worked well for them" she said in reference to the Buckeys
I just hope to God that years from now we don't hear about Ray Buckey molesting children"
Ira Reiner blamed the criminal justice system for the length of the trial and said he backs two state court-reform initiatives
"Too much time and too much money has gone into this case
The very idea a case can go to trial for 2 1/2 years and there can be a rational result is preposterous
With the acquittal Pounders freed more than $3 million worth of property that had been posted by Buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be released after five years in jail
A county grand jury had indicted them on 115 counts that indictment was superseded in May by a criminal complaint charging them with 208 counts involving 41 children

Hundreds of South Bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide conspiracy and pornography ring it was alleged and an angry mob spray-painted "Ray Must Die" on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains
Perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy voice of having been raped photographed tied up and placed in a dark closet by her teachers five years earlier
The remaining charges had been dropped after only 14 of the scheduled child witnesses came forward to testify
One child was allowed to testify by closed-circuit television under a new state law passed especially for the McMartin case
The trial itself began with jury selection in April 1987
Their testimony was often raw and unsettling
The children's allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians
