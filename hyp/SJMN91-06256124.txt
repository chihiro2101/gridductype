Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas told the Senate Judiciary Committee today it is "irrelevant" whether he holds any personal opinion on abortion spurring new frustration among the committee's Democrats
But as the hearings' third day got under way no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation seemed to be emerging
Asked several times by Sen Herb Kohl D-Wis about women's right to end their pregnancies Thomas said "Whether or not I have a view is irrelevant"
President Bush asked at a news conference whether Thomas' claim not to have an opinion on abortion is credible answered "That's a question for the Senate to decide"
Thomas' answers have frustrated the committee's Democrats who say he is an evasive witness
After still another Thomas answer Biden said "That's not the question I asked you judge"
Republicans tried to deflect criticism over Thomas' refusal to answer questions from the Democrats
"It is in my view inappropriate to keep this up" said Sen Orrin Hatch R-Utah
If that's so said Sen Paul Simon D-Ill
Kohl asked the black federal judge whether he was offended by published comments calling his appointment by President Bush a "quota"
He said Bush assured him he was picked because he was the best qualified of those potential nominees considered
Two pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- Howell Heflin D-Ala and Arlen Specter R-Pa -- also voiced concern about Thomas' answers
But the panel's traditional third swing vote Dennis DeConcini D-Ariz said Thomas was doing well
