Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was prepared to head back to Moscow today to reclaim power after the hard-line coup against him collapsed and its leaders reportedly fled
Outside the Russian parliament which served as the headquarters for resistance led by Boris Yeltsin rejoicing crowds cheered and waved flags as the coup ended
Gorbachev was set to board a plane in the Crimea where he was vacationing at the time of Monday's coup for the two-hour flight to Moscow said a deputy to Russian Defense Minister Konstantin Kobets
The Soviet leader in a statement for radio and television said he was fully in command of the situation and that the coup leaders would bear "full responsibility" for their actions
The three-day coup one of the most tumultuous developments in recent Soviet history unraveled in a series of swift and dramatic developments today
The full legislature nullified the coup leaders' emergency decrees
"I'm sorry comrades but I'm very excited" said a Soviet TV announcer grinning broadly after he was allowed for the first time to criticize the coup leaders' actions
In the secessionist Baltic republics which had borne the brunt of the post-coup crackdown some Soviet troops began returning to their permanent bases
Yeltsin addressed the Russian parliament today and said the Soviet Union had just "gone through a most tragic moment in its history and perhaps the most tragic moment"
The plane reportedly carrying the coup leaders was said to be headed to the city of Bishkek formerly called Frunze the capital of Kirgizia 2100 miles southeast of Moscow according to Radio Russia which speaks for Yeltsin
But sources at the airport told the Associated Press that only KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov was on a plane and it was headed to the Crimea
He reportedly was accompanied by Communist Party No 2 leader Vladimir Ivashko
The report could not be independently confirmed and the discrepancies could not be clarified
The state of emergency was declared after hard-line elements in the military and Communist Party ousted Gorbachev declaring he was ill
