The 26-year-old drifter with a long criminal record who launched a mute murderous assault on a California elementary school Tuesday was described by his aunt as a loner and childhood alcoholic police said
Patrick E Purdy purchased an AK-47 rifle in this Portland suburb several months ago then returned to his hometown of Stockton Calif where he used the gun to kill five children and wound 29 others along with a teacher at Cleveland Elementary School before taking his own life authorities said
Purdy who went by the alias of Patrick West had lived with an aunt and uncle in Sandy from the first of July until late October said Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel
He later moved to Lodi Calif where he listed his mailing address under the name of his grandmother Julia Chumbley although he did not live with her authorities said
I don't understand why and I probably won't ever know why'' said Ms Chumbley a 63-year-old retired cannery worker
However Purdy had an ``extensive criminal history'' mostly in the Los Angeles area said Lucian Neely deputy police chief in Stockton an agricultural city 60 miles east of San Francisco
