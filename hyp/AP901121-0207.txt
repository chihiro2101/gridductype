Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life He was to play on John Lennon's new album
Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years busy taking care of his son Sean and admittedly out of songwriting ideas
But in 1980 he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife Yoko Ono
Afterall Lennon gave no press conferences and didn't attend clubs or concerts
To Newmark Lennon was a hero and only a hero
The drummer guessed he was something like the intense irreverent young man of the movies ``Help''
``His straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the stories and images we had created
Newmark spent just one month in the studio playing on the songs that eventually ended up on ``Double Fantasy'' and ``Milk and Honey'' Lennon's final albums
The music was mostly mainstream pop no 18-minute jams or political anthems
``Dear Yoko'' and ``Grow Old With Me'' were tributes to his wife
Lennon defended his self-imposed retirement on ``Watching the Wheels'' and summed up his feelings about turning 40 on ``Borrowed Time'' capping the line ``Good to be older'' with a self-assured ``you bet''
Between takes Lennon jammed on Buddy Holly songs and played host
``Guys I'm taking off'' Lennon would say as he poured himself another cup
Reunions were out of the question a return to adolescence in his opinion but talking about the old days seemed the nicest kind of high
``By this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did and be proud of it'' Newmark said
By the fall Newmark had finished working on the album and his contact with Lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the studio
