Television watchers of the 19th annual New York City Marathon followed the step-by-step progress Sunday of the leaders but many spectators on the course scanned the thousands of runners for a familar face
The winner in the field of 23478 _ largest ever for a marathon _ was Steve Jones of Wales who finished in 2 hours 8 minutes and 20 seconds only seven seconds off the course record
Grete Waitz of Norway won the women's division for a record ninth time in 22807
She and several others had staked out the corner table at a restaurant on First Avenue to get a good view of the runners as they romped off the Queensboro Bridge
Their hopes on seeing Giannelli depended on how fast the Yonkers native ran
The manager's kicking us out'' said one of Giannelli's friends Pete Koogan
All along the marathon route volunteers handed drinks to runners but Rick Fairlamb of Glen Rock NJ had prepared a special elixir of carrot juice
He handed them out to the 50 or so runners in the ``Natural Living'' running club who passed his table at 61st Street and First Avenue
