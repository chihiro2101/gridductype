The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers home of the Bombay Stock Exchange was rocked by two powerful bombs last Friday leaving 60 dead and 200 injured
The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal
It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring where it stopped a year ago
But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday and the index came back by 5062 or 21 per cent to 240923
All this has taken place against a volatile background the Bombay equity market over the past six weeks or so has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation before the national budget on February 27 and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment
Dr Manmohan Singh the Indian finance minister disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month
He postponed corporate tax reforms by a year denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group
He lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at 445 per cent
The Indian stock markets have been passing through a series of crises since December when activists of the Bhartiya Janta party pulled down the Babri mosque at Ayodhya sparking off communal riots
