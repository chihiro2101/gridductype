Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ``gamburgers'' ``chizburgers'' and ``Filay-o-feesh'' sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for the first time
The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30000 meals on 27 cash registers breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide officials said
The Soviets bundled in fur coats and hats seemed unfazed lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant the first of 20 planned across the Soviet Union
``I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before me'' said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant
Big Macs were priced at 375 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently
Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children Gary Reinblatt senior vice president of McDonald's Canada said from Toronto
Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast friendly service
Normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard
McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon the man behind the deal said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served 15000 to 20000 people in just the first five hours of operation
