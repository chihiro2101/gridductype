[Text] Guangzhou June 23 (XINHUA) -- The highest flood peaks on the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers have passed said Zhu Senlin governor of south China's Guangdong Province
While inspecting flood control and relief work in Qingyuan city on the Beijiang River yesterday he attributed Guangdong's success in combating this flood -- almost the biggest in 100 years -- to concerted efforts by the armymen stationed in Guangdong and local residents
The flood was caused by successive torrential rainstorms in the Xijiang and Beijiang River valleys in early and middle June
No breaches of major embankments or reservoirs were reported despite the most serious flood in a hundred years effectively protecting the safety of the provincial capital Guangzhou and the Pearl (Zhujiang) River Delta
