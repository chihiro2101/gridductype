ON A recent day the telephone rang in the home of William Wegman
The photographer known for his hilarious portraits of his Weimaraners picked up
In this house man and dogs speak as one
One need only listen while Wegman murmurs to Fay Ray and Battina her 1 1/2-year-old daughter
On Valentine's Day for example he said "I'll take them out and play with them longer"
"But I don't want to be known as a dog zombie" said Wegman who did go to the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show without the dogs
I swim play tennis and wind surf"
When Bill leaves Batty howls" said Andrea Beeman an assistant to Wegman
His life with Weimaraners began in 1970 the year he bought a new video camera and Man Ray a puppy that cost $35
Wegman had never photographed dogs before but Man Ray was a perfect subject
In 1985 he got Fay Ray who is now a familiar face not only among artists but among children who watch "Sesame Street"
As a breed Weimaraners combine "a lap-dog sensibility with a hunting capability" the artist said
