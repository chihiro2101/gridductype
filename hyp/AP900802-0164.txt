Iraq says it invaded Kuwait at the request of a revolutionary organization there but diplomats dismiss that rationale as a large-scale charade
The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the flood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the Provisional Free Kuwait Government
Britain's UN ambassador Crispin Tickell called the Iraqi action ``an invasion from the outside  a phony coup d'etat from within''
In a rare display of solidarity the United States and the Soviet Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions
But Iraq's deputy permanent UN representative Sabah Talat Kadrat said the Security Council should not be debating the issue because the fall of the Kuwaiti Emir Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah was an internal matter
The statement also said the Al-Sabah family which had ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years was working in concert with Zionist and colonial powers to plot against Iraq
