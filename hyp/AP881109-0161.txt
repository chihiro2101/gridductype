The visit by human rights activist Andrei D Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the US ``Star Wars'' program
That report from Radio Moscow carried on its international-service news programs Tuesday apparently was the only mention made by Soviet media of Sakharov's visit to the United States which began Sunday
Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the comments about the Reagan administration's space-based anti-missile program at a Boston news conference
Sakharov winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize is scheduled to spend two weeks visiting relatives in the United States undergoing medical tests and promoting a new international organization he belongs to
