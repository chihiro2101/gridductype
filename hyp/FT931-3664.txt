MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1200 injured '
They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in December and again in January
Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya
The weapons used were mostly primitive - knives clubs and petrol bottles
The only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of Mr Rajiv Gandhi the former prime minister by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists
But that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in Bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital
Mr P V Narasimha Rao the prime minister described the blasts as an attack on India's economy
If Moslems are found to have staged the attacks the Indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a Moslem country notably Pakistan
Mr Rao chose his words carefully during his visit to Bombay 'There is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country
At the Gymkhana Club and dozens of other sports grounds hundreds of men and boys were playing cricket as they do every Sunday
