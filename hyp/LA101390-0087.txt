The quick collapse of a bizarre military revolt on the Philippines' second-largest island leaves President Corazon Aquino's beleaguered government with a muddied victory at best and clear danger signs ahead
Analysts here say Aquino's immediate use of small bombers and artillery to end a pocket rebellion led by renegade army Col Alexander Noble on the north coast of Mindanao helps counter oft-heard criticism that her four-year-old government is indecisive and inept
And despite widespread fears that the Oct 4-6 uprising would quickly spread to military garrisons on other islands and become a major threat to Aquino leaders of the rightist military underground failed to move
Noble once chief of staff of Aquino's own security detail quickly linked up with Reuben Canoy a local politician who heads the so-called Mindanao Independence Movement
The resource-rich island has spawned secession groups since the 16th Century -- though Canoy's is the first to print fake passports and currency based on crude counterfeits of US $5 bills
Noble best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap quickly surrendered with most of his motley army of soldiers and Higaonon tribal militiamen after two World War II-vintage T-28 planes called Tora Toras here bombed and strafed one of the camps
"This time was a different government response altogether which Noble clearly had underestimated" said University of the Philippines political scientist Alex Magno
After 332 witnesses 226 sworn statements and 4100 documents the so-called Davide Commission concluded that coup attempts are likely to continue -- but unlikely to succeed -- for the indefinite future
