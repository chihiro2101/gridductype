Such is the life of one German short-haired pointer a show dog bearing the name CH
He has won 245 show awards as Best of Breed and 19 awards as Best in Show
In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match the one owner Anthony Attalla is suing the other two John and Rita Remondi charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News)
In the suit filed in federal district court in Manhattan Mr Attalla says "Cory has achieved the pinnacle of success
In the suit he says that under the owners' agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show -- or to retire -- Cory
In a memo filed in court Mr Remondi claims that Mr Attalla retired the dog "simply and solely to better" the chances that Mr Attalla's agent would win with a rival Rover
The Remondis also say Mr Attalla has bought a Rottweiler to show in another category and doesn't want to spend money on both Cory and the other dog
