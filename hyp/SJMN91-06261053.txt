Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of Senate questioning Monday apparently well on his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court
"I have been honored to participate in this process" Thomas said before breaking into a broad grin and effusively gripping the hands of his Judiciary Committee interrogators
The committee will continue to hear testimony for and against Thomas at least through the end of the week but the outcome does not seem to be in doubt
Several committee members said they expected the committee to recommend by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote that the Senate confirm Thomas
Regardless of the outcome Thomas said on his way out of the hearing "I have been treated fairly"
Sen Edward Kennedy D-Mass delivered a long stinging lecture to Thomas declaring "The vanishing views of Judge Thomas have become a major issue in these hearings"
Moderate Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania who often casts a swing vote on the committee said he was not troubled by Thomas' shift toward more moderate views at the hearings
