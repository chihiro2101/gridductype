Tuesday's earthquake the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San Francisco quake on April 18 1906 came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern California within the next 30 years
The epicenter of the temblor eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27 1988 and Aug 8 1989
The US Geological Survey in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in California said there was a 30% chance of another 65-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018
The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake
Thomas Heaton the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency's Pasadena field office said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as "preshocks" of the Tuesday's 69 temblor
He said "foreshocks" would not be the proper term since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck
After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains the state Office of Emergency Services and the US Geological Survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes ranging up to 65 magnitude within the next few days in the vicinity
But these warnings said that if nothing happened then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity
Although Tuesday's quake was powerful Waverly Person chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden Colo cautioned that at 69 magnitude it should be considered only a "strong" shock not a "major" one as a quake in the 70 to 79 range would be classified or a "great" one as a quake of 80 or above would be
Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in Southern California sometime in the next three decades
Person said that like most San Andreas earthquakes this was most likely to be a strike-slip quake with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another
Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake
The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake San Jose has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years but several of them have been on the Calaveras fault which generally runs just east of San Jose more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point
Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may have been a precursor or somehow added pressure on the San Andreas
Iben Browning of Sandia Park N M said he had based his prediction on an assessment of tidal forces caused by the moon's relationship with the Earth
