The damaged battleship USS Iowa steamed home from Puerto Rico on Friday while investigators on board interviewed crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that killed 47 sailors
Karl Johnson an Atlantic Fleet spokesman said the Navy would not release the exact position of the ship which was expected to reach its home port here about 530 pm Sunday
The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions that crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces
Navy investigators also said the explosion left two fully loaded gun barrels in the turret the newspaper reported
After the fire was extinguished crew men worked quickly to remove the shells and powder from the other two guns before they could explode the newspaper said
Meanwhile NBC News reported that the exact cause of the blast in one of the ship's three 16-inch gun turrets on Wednesday may never be known because the destruction inside the turret was so complete
Tom Johnston a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk said he had no information on the cause of death of the 47 crewmen
Ships with those guns _ the battleships Iowa New Jersey Missouri and Wisconsin _ were built during World War II
