The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California
A 1988 report by the US Geological Survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 65 magnitude on the Richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains
The high probability is based on several factors including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906 said Clarence Allen professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena
He noted that the 1988 report titled ``Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault'' presented information that was already widely known among scientists
Frank Baldwin of US Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 69 on the Richter scale
The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area which registered a 59 Richter reading Allen said
Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the Los Angeles region
