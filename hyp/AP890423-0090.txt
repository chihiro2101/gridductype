The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port where about 3000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors
Twenty minutes later families started filing aboard the ship exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors
``They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get home'' said Capt Steven Karalekas
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No 2 gun turret which extends six decks down into the ship
The center gun where the blast occurred was depressed
The somber mood was heightened by the lack of bands and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked
Adm Powell Carter commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet was on the dock to greet the vessel
The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday
Throughout the Norfolk area churches dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen
The families of the victims were invited but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend
Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun the newspaper said
The Iowa and its sister ships the battleships Missouri New Jersey and Wisconsin were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet despite the explosion
