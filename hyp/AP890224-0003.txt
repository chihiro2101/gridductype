To the rest of the world he was known as Emperor Hirohito but in Japan his given name was seldom used
In Japanese he was simply called Tenno Heika meaning His Majesty The Emperor
The foreign habit of using his name rankled some Japanese who found it impolite and unnecessary since to them there is only one emperor
It means Enlightened Peace and has been succeeded by Heisei or Achieving Peace the name the government chose for the reign of Hirohito's son
The obituary issued in English by the Foreign Press Center which is supported by the Foreign Ministry was headed ``His late Majesty The Emperor Hirohito''
