[Editorial "There Are Signs of Conservative Party Changing Its Leader"]
In local government elections across Britain yesterday the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats
The results of the local elections showed that the Tories were reduced to the third party nationally behind the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party
The Labour Party controls 90 local councils whereas the Conservatives only control 13 with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides
The Liberal Democrats had a net gain of 378 seats
Even some former Conservative members of parliament announced publicly to reporters that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats
In the deep sorrow of defeat some Conservatives are secretly feeling happy
They resent John Major's leadership and would most willingly link Major's incompetence and lack of vision with the bitter defeat in the local elections
The right-winger Michael Portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the European issue and highlighted John Major's image as a loser who fails to command
John Major is someone who was propped up by Mrs Thatcher who supported appointing the mediocre John Major as her successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and continue to pursue the Thatcher line
" On the European issue he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty cultural traditions and life-style of each country of the future European Union while reflecting the islanders' mind set
On the one hand he expressed the will to join the European family on the other he made one big stride closer to the right
While great skill is needed to have one's bread buttered on both sides John Major has been relatively stupid in such circumstance
It will be difficult for John Major to lead the Tories in the next general election therefore news spread earlier this year that John Major would be replaced
