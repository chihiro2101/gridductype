Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei D Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as his country's conscience
Crimean Tatars and Jewish refuseniks _ two of the groups Sakharov helped _ joined rank-and-file Communists teachers and engineers in filing past the body of the physicist Nobel Peace Prize winner human rights advocate and legislator
Based on official sources an estimated 45000 people filed through and the flow of mourners continued into the night
one elderly woman cried out as she saw Sakharov's body in an open coffin sloping to the floor of the beige marble Youth Palace in central Moscow
A mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at Sakharov's feet and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing Sakharov with his hands over his mouth deep in thought
Sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies and the outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote city of Gorky
There were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of 9 million people as though a government leader had died
Police lined the sidewalks where people waited
``Sakharov always was telling the truth and by doing so forced our leadership to do the same'' said Boris Sorokin a 50-year-old designer
Unofficial shrines sprouted outside Sakharov's southeast Moscow apartment where candles flickered alongside his portrait
``History's most peaceful rebel in dying did not come down from the cross but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric of the world''
Bonner Sakharov's constant companion and fellow human rights activist sat closest to the coffin clutching a black handbag and periodically closing her eyes
The foreign dignitaries expected to take part in Monday's ceremonies include Lech Walesa head of Poland's Solidarity movement who will be making his first trip to the Soviet Union and former refuseniks Yosef Begun and Vladimir Slepak who now live in Israel
