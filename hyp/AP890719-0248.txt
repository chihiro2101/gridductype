President Mikhail S Gorbachev said today that thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest threatens his economic reforms
Strikes have shut down more than 200 mines and factories in the country's two top coal-producing regions official reports said
In a report to the Supreme Soviet Gorbachev said they have resulted in a 1 million-ton drop in coal production
Following Gorbachev to the podium legislator Anatoly Saunin said each lost work day cost millions of rubles that might otherwise help improve living conditions
Saunin from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine the country's top coal region said the number of striking mines there increased from 20 on Tuesday to 58 today
Miners began walking out July 11 in Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin coal region
Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I Ryzhkov sent a telegram to miners in the Ukraine assuring them that any concessions granted to Siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well
If the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy ``We may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing'' Gorbachev said without specifying what steps he would take
The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N Slyunkov a member of the ruling Communist Party body who worked several years in the tractor-building industry and has spoken about labor discipline
He held marathon meetings with strikers Monday night and Tuesday and addressed 30000 people in the main square of Prokopyevsk 2100 miles east of Moscow
