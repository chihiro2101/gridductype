Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect authorities said
The storm which caused billions in damage claimed 17 lives in South Carolina and only two were in the Charleston area which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds
``We just feel very thankful about that'' said Mayor Joseph P Riley Jr
The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979 which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida
``We've had so many close calls'' said Gary Garnet a meteorologist with the National Weather Service
