An anti-American newspaper in Iran said Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake
The ``criminal role of America in Iran's past became evident once again in the recent earthquake'' the Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency
``Our people even under the rubble chant `Death to America' and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States  even those hands stretched out to help'' it said
Iran at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the US Embassy in Tehran has said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other US humanitarian groups
