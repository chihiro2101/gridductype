Spike Lee may have been wearing a Georgetown University cap and sweatshirt but he got a far warmer reception from Syracuse University students than he did from Academy Award voters
In a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday Lee shrugged off the academy's icy treatment of his latest movie ``Do the Right Thing'' and blamed it on generational politics

He said they were ``a lot more comfortable with the black chauffeur in `Driving Miss Daisy''' than with the angry characters in his film
