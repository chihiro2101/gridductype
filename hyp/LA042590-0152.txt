The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $15-billion Hubble Space Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar panel narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk
The telescope began orbiting Earth every 973 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles -- high above the atmosphere which has limited the view of ground-based telescopes
"Discovery go for Hubble release" Mission Control told the crew at 1237 pm PDT
The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away as the telescope glinting in the sunlight drifted off on its 15-year search for new worlds
Mission Control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help
Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12 1/2-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries
Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless had put on spacesuits and entered an air lock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array in case mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed
