In what amounted to a public apology Mikhail S Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D Sakharov as a ``man of honesty and sincerity'' who suffered great injustice at the hands of previous rulers
An obituary signed by Gorbachev five other members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 of the party daily Pravda
Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and scientists and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a funeral commission in a black box on its front page
``A distinguished scientist and public figure a man of honesty and sincerity has passed away'' the obituary said
``Everything that Andrei Dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience his deep humanitarian convictions''
It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members Nikolai I Ryzhkov Vadim A Medvedev Lev N Zaikov Alexander N Yakovlev and Vitaly I Vorotnikov
However the signatures of several other Politburo members including KGB chief Vladimir A Kryuchkov and leading conservative Yegor K Ligachev were missing
The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb
