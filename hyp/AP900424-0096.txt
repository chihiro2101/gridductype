Seven years late the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time
Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday the $15 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal
At the sign of life applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston
Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space
There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time
NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad
It suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle

Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station
The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter about the size of a railroad tank car

The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 949 am EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California
