With the old order of Bolshevik power and ideology in ruins Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev demanded the resignation Friday of his entire government and Russian President Boris Yeltsin shut down Communist Party organizations throughout the vast republic
Ministers appointed only Thursday by Gorbachev were fired and replaced Friday
Yeltsin the triumphant leader of the resistance against this week's military coup has drastically tipped the balance of power here showing himself to be at least the political equal if not the master of Gorbachev
In a symbol of the new order the Russian tricolor the banner of the anti-coup resistance flew over the gates of the Kremlin alongside the red Soviet flag for the first time since the rise of the Bolshevik state
"And now for a bit of relaxation" Yeltsin said interrupting Gorbachev's speech "
Gorbachev who has insisted the party is still capable of reform stammered a bit and then said "Boris Nikolayevich Boris Nikolayevich   "
Former Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin will head the KGB Gen Yevgeny Shaposhnikov the air force chief becomes defense minister and former Russian Interior Minister Victor Barannikov will be the union's interior minister
All three men took a clear stand against the coup and are expected to move quickly to reform the key institutions they now head
Although Bessmertnykh said he had refused to go along with the coup leaders Gorbachev said he had information that his top diplomat had been "maneuvering or at least did not take a firm stand"
In both Moscow and Leningrad city officials ordered police to seal off Communist Party headquarters
Gavril Popov said investigators had to make a thorough search of party buildings and documents to determine the scope of the coup and its participants
As Gorbachev struggled during the 90-minute session of the Russian parliament he called for "maturity and balance" in judging the conspirators and said "Let's not have a witch hunt"
Yeltsin also seemed eager to impress on Gorbachev just how thoroughly he had been betrayed by his own ministers and presumed allies
It had been Gorbachev who ordered Yeltsin out of a hospital bed in 1987 to face a vengeful meeting of the Moscow Communist Party Committee
"If one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even give orders like what happened now his rights and responsibilities are automatically taken by the other" Gorbachev said
Pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted Gorbachev from power but he was reportedly taken ill on Sunday night when the coup began
