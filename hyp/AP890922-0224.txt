Six novels have been nominated for the Booker Prize Britain's most prestigious fiction award and bookmakers say the favorite is ``The Remains of the Day'' by Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro
The award to be announced Oct 26 carries a $31600 prize funded by the Booker McConnell food company
Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about a butler's travels through Britain's West Country and said it was ``a firm favorite'' to win
Ishiguro previously nominated for the award ``was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986 which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe
