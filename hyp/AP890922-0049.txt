This historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo
The storm packing winds of up to 135 mph raged into Charleston Thursday night
``This is a dangerous killer hurricane the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced'' warned Mayor Joseph P Riley Jr
Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959
