Gov George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake
With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible and as soon as is practical
Deukmejian should be commended as well for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape
The governor is wrong however in his campaign to distance himself from the California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse and what could or should have been done to have prevented it
The governor's answer which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake
While the Department of Transportation and the state Transportation Commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds the governor also sets general state priorities
The state learns more from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from Tuesday Oct 17
In the Bay Area that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage but face massive obstacles in getting to work
