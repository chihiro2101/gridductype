It's a dog's life for Bill McFadden
The 32-year-old professional dog handler knows that the secret to producing champions is just plain doggone hard work
And like a racehorse jockey he crisscrosses the country showing the dogs for a variety of owners
McFadden and his wife Taffe run their dog handling business in Campbell and do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings
McFadden's latest product a Kerry blue terrier named Kerrageen's Hotspur won the best of show prize at the 81st Golden Gate Kennel Club Dog Show held Feb 2-3 at the Cow Palace in San Francisco
Kerrageen's Hotspur was scheduled to join McFadden in New York City last week for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden
Recognized as one of the most prestigious shows in all of dogdom Westminster is also with the exception of the Kentucky Derby the longest continuous sporting event held in the US
