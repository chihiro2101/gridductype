Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged fire for several hours today after a Pakistani soldier became the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border officers and a western observer said
The soldier was shot in the leg Sunday at a ceasefire line several miles from the village of Chaukothi officials said on condition of anonymity
They said there were no reports of casualties from today's firefight at the line which divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India
The nations have twice gone to war over the Himalayan state in 1948 and again in 1965
Relations between the neighbors have become increasingly strained since Jan 20 when Indian troops launched a military crackdown on Moslem separatists in turbulent Jammu-Kashmir
The militants want India's only majority Moslem state to either become independent or join Pakistan
