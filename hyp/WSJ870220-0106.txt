A crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here March 1 to run 26 miles 385 yards
And cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees
Makers of cars soda pop sportswear copiers computers -- even a hospital -- have tagged their names to the Los Angeles Marathon

Runners it seems are a well-heeled lot

The exclusive franchise calls for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum $60000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipts to the city
The organizers also will pay the cost of city services for the marathon estimated at $100000
The race sponsors and city officials are trading freely on the good will generated by Los Angeles's role as host of the 1984 Olympics
