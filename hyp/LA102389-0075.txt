Although they are a continent apart the cities of Charleston SC and San Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time
They are the scenes of two of the century's costliest back-to-back natural disasters Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake
"From the standpoint of compassion of all the people in America we can feel the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most" Charleston Mayor Joseph P Riley Jr said Sunday one month after Hugo hit
Unlike earthquakes hurricanes can be tracked by planes and radar their paths predicted with sufficient certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee
Still at least 28 deaths in the Carolinas are blamed on Hugo while at least 60 deaths have been attributed to the Bay Area earthquake
Hugo 500 miles across with winds topping 175 mph left virtually every street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's buildings with some degree of damage
Five days after the storm many city residents remained inconvenienced most without electricity many without safe drinking water
Broken glass and other debris left the roadsides lined with cars stopped by flat tires
Cable cars began carrying passengers Sunday and the curtain went up on the opera
"Their streets were immediately passable" said Charleston Police Chief Ruben Greenberg
It's likely to take a lot longer for the tourists themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the city's biggest industries
Water mains and gas lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months
Millions were watching the pregame World Series program when the earthquake struck and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster
Greenberg who has now watched the federal government respond to two of America's worst disasters said he sees relatively few differences between how the Federal Emergency Management Agency worked in South Carolina and Northern California
