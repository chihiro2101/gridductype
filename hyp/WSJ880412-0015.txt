Two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns
The subject was no laughing matter but rather the serious endeavor of finding South Korea's Ronald McDonald
Seven years after the US hamburger giant first tried to bring its Big Macs to South Korea the golden arches were finally going up
McAhn Industries Ltd recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul
The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp Oak Brook Ill and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur Ahn Hyo Young
But its entry into South Korea which has Asia's fastest-growing economy had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from Seoul on terms
South Korea may be one of McDonald's most promising foreign markets business analysts say
The venture is rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper more oldfashioned approach a brief advertising campaign in newspapers distribution of fliers and word of mouth
