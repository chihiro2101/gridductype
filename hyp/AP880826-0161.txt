An earthquake that devastated parts of Nepal and India earlier this week has killed more than 980 people officials from the two countries said Friday
Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to earthquake victims
``Hang the murderers'' scores of young men chanted as they marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of Karna Hyanju once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed Communist Party
Witnesses said Hyanju was beaten with umbrellas and sticks late Thursday afternoon then dragged through the streets for nearly two hours before police intervened
He died Friday at the Bir hospital in Katmandu 7 miles west of Bhaktapur
Uttam Dhaubanjar a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man said Hyanju had been handing out blankets milk and other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters
Reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from remote parts of Nepal on Friday and the Home Affairs Ministry updated its confirmed death toll to 704
