it's no surprise really that those '70s rejects have staged comebacks

The Evil One who single-handedly killed the Beatles and destroyed her husband's talent and ambition
Who could possibly regard her as anything other than a crackpot and a public menace

In 1991 Ono says she has tried to "relax a little and do my own stuff"
Ono began her art career as an abstract impressionist then went avant-garde
Ono still lives in the Dakota apartment house in New York the site of Lennon's murder by a crazed fan

Ono married a second time in 1963 to avant-garde artist Tony Cox
The couple had one child a daughter named Kyoko
"Songwriters in this world are pretty harmless people" she says
"They're not doing anything like creating a nuclear bomb or trying to decide whether people should be killed
They're pretty peaceful people and their songs will hopefully inspire people
