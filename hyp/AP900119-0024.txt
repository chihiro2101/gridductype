A therapist defended her interviews of alleged victims in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions undermined the prosecution's case
The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey of 52 child molestation counts and deadlocked on 13 other counts
Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of McMartin students and suggested that the goals of therapy are at odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal prosecution
Evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest and most expensive criminal trial in US history included videotaped interviews of the alleged victims
Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the sexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane a social worker and director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's Institute International
``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them I could have believed the children a little more'' juror Brenda Williams said
