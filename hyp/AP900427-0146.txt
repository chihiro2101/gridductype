The Hubble Space Telescope orbited with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction
Those problems however were not the immediate concern of shuttle Discovery's astronauts who prepared for Sunday's return to Earth
It's on its own'' Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members
``That's great news'' replied Discovery commander Loren J Shriver
I'll bet it's just that way back down there too'' added mission specialist Steven Hawley
``We reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on the ground''
Discovery is to land at 948 am EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base Calif
Landing would have been delayed a day if astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to perform a space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover or aperture door
The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture door opened 380 miles above Earth but passed 37 miles beneath the telescope later in the day
But Steve Terry director of orbital verifications said that would be delayed by problems with Hubble's high-speed antennas
Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the heavens at 1030 am EDT nearly four hours later than planned exposing its finely polished 945-inch mirror to starlight for the first time
The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros said Dave Drachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland
Tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions Terry said
He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth the faster it is moving away
In honor of the astronomer Sullivan carried with her into space an eyepiece from the 100-inch telescope at California's Mount Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to make his pioneering observations
