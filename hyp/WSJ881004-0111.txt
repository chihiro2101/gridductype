The 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't even over when advertisers began clamoring for pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton
She went on to grin relentlessly through some $5 million worth of commercial endorsements -- surely an Olympic record in itself
But when the 1988 Summer Games ended Sunday night so too did the chance for American athletes to follow in her footsteps
"I suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the Olympics" says Jerry Della Femina chairman of ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS
"This is the first Olympics without passion and without passion you don't have testimonials
Without heroes you don't have anyone that anyone wants to emulate"
Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking his head on the springboard then coming back to win two gold medals
Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner her two-inch fingernails raking the air as she won the 100-meter sprint
Earlier this year sports marketers estimated that a gold medal won during the Summer Games could earn a personable athlete more than $1 million in endorsements
Advertisers can reel off a litany of reasons why these Olympics aren't igniting much spark
Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build
The constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didn't help either
Now they can appear in as many ads as they want but the income must go into a trust fund for training expenses
Companies also are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to celebrity endorsements
Increasingly cost conscious they will no longer hook up with an Olympian just because the company president likes the athlete's sport
Companies now know that "six months from now there will be other heroes from other sporting events" for them to consider
Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude toward the Olympics is becoming typical
It uses sports stars in its commercials for Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds but has no plans to call on any of 1988's Olympians
"People like Michael Jordan have 10-plus years in their sports careers all in a row so I don't have to worry about the public saying 'Carl who'"
And according to her agent Pearl Hodge of World Class Management she is now "in the process" of signing with McDonald's Corp to work on behalf of its efforts to aid underprivileged children
(The sprinter's manager couldn't be reached for comment)
Another Olympian with endorsement potential is swimmer Matt Biondi who won five gold medals
He dives to perform he doesn't dive for dollars"
