Lucille Ball was mourned Wednesday by the western New York hometown she left for Hollywood more than half a century ago
``It is a sad day for all of us
But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world'' said Nelson Garifi organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that was to have been held next month
``She was always so full of life'' said Pauline Lopus who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her
The 77-year-old comedian died of a ruptured aorta the main heart artery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles where she was recovering from emergency heart surgery last week
Mrs Lopus said Miss Ball dreamed of fame either as a dramatic actress in New York City or as a dancing girl in musicals
Celoron had planned to rename a street in Miss Ball's honor during her visit and still plans to rename it as Lucy Lane said John Goodell of Celoron's Historical Society
