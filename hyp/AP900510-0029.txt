The Bush administration is expected to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first US ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years a US official says
The administration had planned to send another career diplomat Melissa Wells to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives
The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that US-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party
The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight Nicaraguan envoys in Washington including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann
Shlaudeman who has served as ambassador to Argentina Peru Brazil and Venezuela is a premier State Department specialist on Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation
