SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation
The son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville in the backwaters of Arkansas in 1950 writes Martin Dickson
By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues and the Walton family probably America's richest
Employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in US service industries - was also a vital ingredient in the Walton philosophy
