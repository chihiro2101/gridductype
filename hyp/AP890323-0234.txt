The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon
Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on
His example is followed by other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field
Says Ed Nagy district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas metropolitan area ``It's not like `Uh-oh someone's coming' because they're always out''
Everyone from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer David Glass down to an hourly store worker can readily quote the gospel according to Sam as he is called
To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing ``Rule No1 is the customer is always right
Rule No2 says just in case the customer's wrong revert to rule No1''
Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late 1960s
The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake in Wal-Mart stock is worth about $68 billion
He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economics degree in 1940 and joined JC Penney Co as a management trainee in Des Moines Iowa
The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his brother James L or Bud opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962
