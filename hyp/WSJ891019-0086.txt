Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake
Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month
The earthquake's toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says George Reider a vice president in Aetna Life &amp Casualty Insurance Co's claims division
Reflecting that logic insurance-company stocks posted strong gains
Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage
Most insurers already have mobilized their "catastrophe" teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California
About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks
State Farm based in Bloomington Ind is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California
Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement "rider" on a homeowner's policy in California because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes
State Farm said about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance
That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp based in Novato Calif and Cigna Corp based in Philadelphia
Among the insurance stocks big gainers included American International Group up $325 to $102625 General Re Corp up $275 to $8650 Aetna up $2375 to $5950 and Marsh &amp McLennan Inc up $3125 to $75875
"I think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this" said Oppenheimer &amp Co analyst Myron Picoult
