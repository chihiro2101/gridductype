US intelligence officials had been sounding alarms in recent days about a possible Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
Emphasizing that the Central Intelligence Agency wasn't surprised by the Iraqi action an agency spokesman said yesterday "We provided policy makers with very useful and timely information on these events and we continue to do so"
Since last week President Bush had been warned by intelligence analysts that what originally looked like a military bluff was quickly turning into the kind of troop deployment that could be used to invade Kuwait or even Saudi Arabia
Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster even hand-delivered certain fresh details on the Iraqi buildup to National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
