Two sailors were missing Monday evening after a 652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sank in rough seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod
The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York
The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft but it turned out to be empty
The Star of Alexandria had been en route from Athens Greece to New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds up to 35 mph Midgett said
A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130 plane from Elizabeth City NC converged on the ship
