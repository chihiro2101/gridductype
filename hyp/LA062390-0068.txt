Setting aside years of animosity the US government joined with private humanitarian groups Friday to funnel medicine tents clothing food and other relief materials to help earthquake-stricken Iran
State Department officials said the government gave $300000 worth of supplies to the American Red Cross for shipment to Iran -- including 1000 hard hats 1000 pairs of leather gloves 10000 face masks 2940 wool blankets and about 500 tents
The US military which often is used to ferry relief supplies to countries in need stood ready to offer transport planes and logistics support for any US aid requested by Iran
However a Pentagon official said it is unlikely that the State Department and the White House would authorize a military airlift of supplies
"It's pretty clear that the Iranians don't want us and there are so many alternatives such as private charters it really isn't necessary" the officials said
Late Thursday the Iranian Red Crescent appealed for help from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society a Geneva-based umbrella for international humanitarian organizations
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani who toured the stricken region Friday also appealed for international aid
Pat Davis a spokesman for the American Red Cross in Washington said Friday that although the Red Crescent is highly organized and well equipped the large number of dead and suffering people has forced the Iranian agency to solicit international assistance
Andy Griffel executive director of American Jewish World Service said directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call Friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the Iranian victims
