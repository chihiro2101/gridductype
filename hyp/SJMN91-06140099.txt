PEOPLE in this picture-postcard town of Victorian houses and clean streets don't care what Jay Leno or the polls or the Democrats or disgruntled Republicans have been saying about Dan Quayle
Despite the fact that President Bush's health problems have made the vice president a national preoccupation to people here he's just Danny Quayle from Polk Street -- a really nice guy from a really nice family that runs the local newspaper
He is the most important person ever to come out of this town and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency Huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit
To those who say Quayle does not merit his own exhibition Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is after all the vice president of the United States
The vice president's mother Corinne donated a lock of his baby hair
The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture of Quayle then an aide to Indiana Gov Edgar Whitcomb accompanying her to the race
The exhibition which runs through May 20 was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation a sort of fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nation's 44th and they say least-understood vice president
"He has taken such a bad rap" said Schenkel a foundation board member
If they had a chance to sit down with Dan as a neighbor they would see the extremely good values in the man"
his limited experience ("Look at what they said about Truman
If he would slow down talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying I don't think people would take him the way they do" said Jean Anne Drabenstot the owner of Nick's Kitchen Quayle's favorite restaurant
Hayden Schenkel chairman of the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of David Schenkel says "Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the United States
Most of the Democrats and even some of the Republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him as vice president and they're 100 percent behind him
Nonetheless most of Huntington's 17000 residents have rallied around their native son for the exhibition which tracks his life from infancy through law school from the Senate to the vice presidency
There is Dan Quayle and his brother Chris riding horseback and wearing cowboy hats or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas at Christmas
For example his father James signed the report cards when Dan brought home poor grades and his mother signed when he brought home good ones
