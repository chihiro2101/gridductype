Ground controllers cheered after re-establishing contact Thursday with the $15 billion Hubble Space Telescope through its main antennas
An attempt six hours earlier had failed
``I'm pretty relieved I must say'' said Al Boggess Hubble project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Md
Applause erupted at Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control Center when the high-speed contact was made Thursday afternoon
Controllers sent information to the telescope about its location and ``this basically improved the telescope's knowledge where it was what its position was'' said Goddard's Dave Drachlis
``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system'' Drachlis reported
The problem began Thursday morning when engineers tried pointing the two high-speed antennas toward two widely-separated TDRS satellites without success
The Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion
Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space telescope
