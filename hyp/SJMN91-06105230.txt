The answer may decide the men's winner of Monday's Boston Marathon
For the women the story line is more personal
And for the sentimentalists there will be 83-year-old Johnny Kelley starting in his 60th Boston Marathon
There have only been 35 editions of this race run without him
The last three Boston marathons have turned into reckless speed duels
They have produced five of the top 10 times and eight of the top 15 in the race's storied history
The winner was 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin who outsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient calculating race
Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya the 1987 world champion and 1988 Olympic silver medalist who is making his Boston debut
Salvador Garcia the runner-up to Wakiihuri in last year's New York City Marathon
