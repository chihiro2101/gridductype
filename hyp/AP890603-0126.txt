Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from their communist rulers
A low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100-acre square as bonfires set during the night's confrontation continued to smolder
Hundreds of helmeted troops were deployed on the monument to revolutionary heroes in the square's center and thousands more at important intersections nearby
Gunfire could be heard from several sides and tracers zipped through the sky above Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum one of the main monuments to Chinese communism in the square
Troops first entered the square from the south when a column trotted toward the student encampment about 1 am (noon EDT Saturday)
More soldiers were deployed in front of the Great Hall of the People to the west and a huge convoy with armored vehicles rolled down Changan Avenue to the north side
At 4 am the lamposts that dot the square went ominously dark and the student loudspeaker played the Internationale the socialist anthem
