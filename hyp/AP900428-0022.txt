The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope
``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy'' astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery
The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan
The Pasadena-based group runs the observatory located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles
The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948 when the 200-inch Hale Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego
