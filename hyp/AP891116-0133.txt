Employees at a jewelry store huddled in the vault while the shop came down around them
A man in an apartment building stayed in his bathtub while the bathroom walls crumbled and fell
``Everybody was screaming and windows started breaking and the roof started to fall'' recalled Vincent Davis a fourth-grader at Jones Valley Elementary School
Lynn Culpepper was in his bathtub at the Waterford Square apartments where at least a dozen buildings were destroyed
``The next thing I knew glass was breaking and I was rolling on the ground'' he recalled
Manager Bob Husman of a Golbro jewelry store ordered employees into the vault shortly before the roof and walls crashed down on him 20 feet from the vault
The employees in the vault were dug out an hour after the collapse shaken but not hurt
For Ed Rolan a medic the devastation brought back memories of Vietnam
Rolan who was driving home when the tornado hit went right to work helping the stricken motorists around him
The enormity of the death and destruction ``sank in very quickly'' Rolan said
