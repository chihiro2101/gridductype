New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before perhaps even three days after their attacks a study published today concludes
Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early
``It was an extraordinarily safe strategy'' said Dr Eric J Topol the study's director
Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator or TPA and angioplasty
Angioplasty can produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with tiny balloons
However the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted
When President Dwight D Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in 1955 he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital
In an accompanying editorial Dr Gregory D Curfman a deputy editor of the journal cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays
