Leonard Bernstein the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist composer conductor and teacher and was as well the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment
On Cahill's advice the conductor had announced Tuesday that he would retire
Cahill said progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung infections had left Bernstein too weak to continue working
His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood Mass on Aug 19
Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces while conducting from the piano
With it he became a personality well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show
And he lifted popular music to a higher plane infusing performers and listeners with his manic joy in creating tonal sound
"Some conductors mellow with age" commented Times music critic Martin Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 1986
His father Samuel Joseph Bernstein was an entrepreneur of women's hair care products and a Talmudic scholar
"When he was 4 or 5 he would play an imaginary piano on his windowsill"
When his kindergarten teacher asked "Louis Bernstein" to stand up he remained seated and looked around the room to see who shared his last name
He reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects taught at the 300-year-old Boston Latin School
At Harvard University Bernstein studied piano and composition but developed a serious interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron Copland
His performance captivated the man he had met in the balcony who of course was Copland
Copland introduced Bernstein to several composers and got him his first job -- transcribing music for the publisher Boosey and Hawkes
Ironically Copland subsequently urged the torn Bernstein to make conducting rather than composing or even piano playing his career
Conducting emerged as a possibility to Bernstein that same year -- 1937 his sophomore year at Harvard -- when he met the Greek conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos during the maestro's visit to campus
Mitropoulos was so impressed with Bernstein's playing that he invited him to attend rehearsals with the Boston Symphony
The maestro also talked with Bernstein privately in his dressing room after concerts promising to keep in touch
And so I found another father first Mitropoulos then Reiner and now Koussevitzky
But the Koussevitzky relationship was very special very warm"
He so revered the maestro that he was married in Koussevitzky's shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff links
Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky newly appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic at his Stockbridge Conn farm
On Nov 14 less than three months after Bernstein got the job guest conductor Bruno Walter fell ill and Rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm
Jennie Tourel had sung Bernstein's "I Hate Music" at her Town Hall
With no rehearsal a hangover and three hours sleep Bernstein was to conduct a complex program broadcast nationwide on CBS radio
"It is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various activities" Bernstein wrote in 1946
His first major composition a symphony titled "Jeremiah" was introduced in 1942 and his first ballet "Fancy Free" and related first musical "On the Town" both debuted in 1944
In writing music Bernstein achieved greater success on Broadway and even in Hollywood than in Lincoln Center
"If I can write one real moving American opera that any American can understand (and one that is notwithstanding a serious musical work) I shall be a happy man" Bernstein said in 1948
When many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with "West Side Story" he disagreed saying "There are moments when I think so but as a sum total it fails to be an opera
In teaching his fourth area of expertise Bernstein taught regularly at Tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures on tonality at Harvard in 1973
It was on television in the 1950s and 1960s with his "Young People's Concerts" of the Philharmonic and "Omnibus" that Bernstein taught the nation
He introduced free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television widening its audience and tripling paid concert attendance
Known for his emotional embraces of both sexes Bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with him throughout the night at his Manhattan apartment or Connecticut country home
A heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until noon he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people
In 1989 he rejected a National Medal of the Arts in protest of the withdrawn $10000 grant (later reinstated) of the National Endowment for the Arts to an art show on AIDS
Staunchly opposed to retiring until last Tuesday Bernstein continued his guest conducting composing and recording perhaps topping his more than 200 records with the best of his best a re-recording of "West Side Story" in 1985
French President Francois Mitterrand saluted "West Side Story" anew in 1986 when he made Bernstein a commander of the Legion of Honor
