The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer congressional sources said Friday
Tower testified last week that he had represented British Aerospace Inc only on civil aviation matters not as a consultant on military systems
But in a divorce deposition taken in June 1987 Tower stated that he had given the company advice on "selling certain systems to the Defense Department"
In the deposition Tower said he represented the firm on a range of military programs and was paid $8000 a month
Records show that the payments continued from June 1986 until December 1988
The discrepancy sources said has prompted concerns about the veracity and completeness of Tower's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation
Lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms which brought him at least $760000 in 2 1/2 years -- not including the more than $200000 British Aerospace paid him
The FBI is looking into new charges about Tower's alleged drinking womanizing and receipt of campaign contributions and has said that it cannot complete the inquiry for another 10 days
Federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that Tower was aware that his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former Unisys executive Charles F Gardner said to be a central figure in the Pentagon bribery investigation
The sworn deposition about Tower's business dealings was never filed in court because Tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife Lilla Burt Cummings
Around the same time he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense firms including Rockwell International Inc Textron Inc LTV Corp and Martin Marietta Corp
The complex Foreign Agents Registration Act requires individuals working for or representing foreign entities in the United States to register with the Justice Department
-- Vice President Dan Quayle talking to reporters on a flight to Florida said that he had known Tower for eight years and "I have never seen him inebriated
Those of us who know him worked with him can attest to the fact that he has not had this problem it did not affect him when he was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee"
