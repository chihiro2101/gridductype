Soviet media once branded Andrei D Sakharov a traitor but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife
This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet Union
The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at Sakharov and his wife fellow dissident Yelena Bonner by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media
Moscow News also pointedly notes that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner has praised Mikhail S Gorbachev's campaign for social and economic reform
The 66-year-old Sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence in their seventh-floor Moscow apartment eating cabbage beet soup potatoes and other simple fare and Sakharov insists on washing the dishes afterward himself the paper said
It said their two-room home was always filled with people seeking Sakharov's aid and that the words most often heard there are ``Help me''
Sakharov a brilliant physicist was allowed to return to Moscow in December 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city of Gorky where he was banished without trial in January 1980
``He simply believes that something helped change the thoughts of the majority into state policy'' Moscow News said``He calls perestroika (restructuring) an enormous event for our country and for the entire world''
