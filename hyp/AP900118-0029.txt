As protests gathered strength last fall East Germany's longtime orthodox leader Erich Honecker ``lost touch with reality'' according to the man who succeeded him as Communist leader only to be ousted later
Egon Krenz the successor and former Politburo member Guenter Schabowski on Wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality that engulfed the hard-liners toward the end
``There was the notion in the former party leadership that everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by the Communist youth group was an action organized by enemy forces'' Krenz told an investigating commission in East Berlin
The testimony was broadcast on East German television
Schabowski said Honecker had personally ordered police attacks against demonstrators in early October working closely with his then-secret police chief Erich Mielke
``All decisions and orders that led to the police actions against demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through Honecker and Mielke''
``Then-general secretary Erich Honecker and the internal security chief Erich Mielke immediately after each session of the Politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of the German Democratic Republic'' Krenz said
