Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin launched a sweeping purge today that dealt a series of stunning blows to the Communist Party power structure including the ouster of top officials the sealing of party headquarters and the curtailing of party activities
Yeltsin appeared today to be acting at least as an equal with Gorbachev and the two clearly agreed on the replacement of old-guard officials by new reformers
In fact the two leaders reached an agreement that permits each man to assume the other's duties in an emergency such as another coup attempt
Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister Alexander Bessmertnykh and his acting defense minister and named a new head of the KGB
And Yeltsin with Gorbachev's blessing fired the heads of state-owned media
The Moscow City Council meanwhile ordered all Communist Party buildings in the capital sealed and all telephone service to party and KGB buildings cut
About 2000 protesters blockaded the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow declaring they were trying to prevent the removal of documents that might contain evidence linking party members to the coup
Some of the demonstrators chanted "Down with the Communist Party"
Yeltsin who had led the nationwide resistance to the coup announced a ban on Communist Party activities in the Russian republic the army police units of the Interior Ministry and the KGB which for decades helped enforce Communist rule
In his speech before the Russian parliament Gorbachev was compelled to affirm as legitimate the decrees issued by Yeltsin during the three-day coup
It wasn't clear whether the Soviet president had intended to back Yeltsin's latest decrees and he balked at proposals by Russian deputies to outlaw the Communist Party saying it would divide the nation
He accused the Communist Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup
In his speech Gorbachev praised "the outstanding role" of Yeltsin his sometimes adversary in halting the hard-line Communist coup
He suspended the publication of six Communist Party newspapers and ordered new chiefs for the official Novosti and Tass news services charging they had supported the takeover
The arrest of the former KGB chief and other Communist Party hard-liners inspired tens of thousands of demonstrators to undreamed-of daring Thursday
