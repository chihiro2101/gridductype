Miners in Pennsylvania and Kentucky today became the third and fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies
The sympathy strikes began Monday in West Virginia and spread to Indiana late Thursday

Union spokesman Joe Corcoran was not in his office and has not returned phone calls this week
Quenon flew to Charleston from St Louis on Thursday to meet with reporters and express Peabody's and the association's concerns about the walkout
An estimated 2300 United Mine Workers members stayed away from their jobs today in Pennsylvania
About 290 miners at Peabody's Camp No 1 mine in Morganfield Ky didn't report for work today said company spokesman Tom Clarke
