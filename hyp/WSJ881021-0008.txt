Say what you want about Albert Goldman the author of the new biography "The Lives of John Lennon" (Morrow $2295) but you've got to hand it to him This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger
Most best-selling pop biographers play it safe They choose a celeb of respectable not to say pristine reputation and then they proceed to blacken it preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess chemical dependency personal unkindness raw business dealings even in some cases dyslexia
The resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions
Now Mr Presley was if you'll forgive the expression a fat target for a writer of Mr Goldman's methods
the "King of Rock 'n' Roll" was in truth more a creature of the old show biz a star whose wholesome image carefully created by PR wizards was ripe for debunking
But in choosing Mr Lennon as his next target Mr Goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable
The leitmotif of Mr Lennon's confessions was that his worst days were behind him and that with Yoko Ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity
Remarkably then the sleazemonger's art has triumphed Mr Goldman's John Lennon is even worse than John Lennon's John Lennon
And Rolling Stone magazine long the house organ for the Lennon publicity machine recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic
Criticizing "The Lives of John Lennon" for insufficient respect to the fallen Beatle's legacy is rather off the point -- like condemning Charles Manson for his bad table manners
