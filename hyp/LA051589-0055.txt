Soviet human rights activist Andrei D Sakharov said Sunday that his country is on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving
While praising the new course in world affairs taken by the Soviet Union as demonstrated by its withdrawal from Afghanistan Sakharov told the congress of the Italian Socialist Party that some aspects of internal affairs are "deeply disturbing"
Sakharov who did not mention the name of President Mikhail S Gorbachev described as "anti-democratic" some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in Soviet Georgia earlier this year
Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies just two years after he was released from seven years of internal exile
