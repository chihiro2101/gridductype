``Ray Will Die'' is scrawled in big black letters on the faded green paint of the McMartin Pre-School testimony to the rage inflamed by the notorious child-molesting case
Former McMartin teachers Raymond Buckey and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey were acquitted Thursday of 52 charges of molesting students
Whatever happens on those charges few in this upper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb would disagree with the judge in the trial William Pounders who once said ``The case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it''
Sue Brown a receptionist at a medical office across the street from the school said she had two friends who were involved in the case and had been convinced of the Buckeys' guilt
``I think they got off scot-free'' Brown said
Alan Lagunoff whose son now 10 testified against the Buckeys stood in front of the run-down long-closed nursery school and talked about his disappointment
A cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as Lagunoff leaned on the rusted chain-link fence surrounding the dilapidated L-shaped building
