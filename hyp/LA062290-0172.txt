Checkpoint Charlie the Berlin Wall border post that symbolized the Cold War was hoisted into history today
As a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its American British and French flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum
Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin
"The checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free" British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a speech
