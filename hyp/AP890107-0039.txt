World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mourned today's death of Emperor Hirohito who surrendered a broken nation to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic pre-eminence
Reaction to Hirohito's death at age 87 however was decidedly cool in several Asian countries including South Korea which endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan
The main opposition party led by Kim Dae-jung said ``We have complex feelings at the death of Hirohito in view of Japan's 20-year rule over Korea during his reign''
A leading newspaper in Seoul The Joong-Ang Daily News wrote that Hirohito's death ``reminds all the Korean people of a disgraced period and  humiliation
Hirohito is the symbolic figure who must assume most and final responsibility for (Japan's) preposterous crimes to the Korean people''
Korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist south in 1945 when US and Soviet troops ended Japan's rule that began in 1910 with Japan's forced annexation of the peninsula
There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Japan but the mass circulation Chinese daily United Evening News said
``Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of Japan's militarists during World War II may bury their animosity with Hirohito's death
