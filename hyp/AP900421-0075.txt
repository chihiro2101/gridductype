Two weeks after a failed launch attempt an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time
The countdown began Saturday afternoon for a launch set for 831 am EDT Tuesday
If the launch goes on schedule and all else goes well the first picture from Hubble could be available next weekend
You can cut it with a knife incredible'' said Eric Chaisson senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore
``There's not a bit of difference'' agreed Charles Pellerin Jr NASA's director of astrophysics
The $15 billion telescope the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built rests safely inside Discovery's payload bay awaiting the Tuesday launch
If all goes well Discovery will return to Edwards Air Force Base Calif on Sunday April 29 with an empty payload bay
NASA said it may release its first telescope image from Hubble _ of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ as early as that same day
After the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done Hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two
The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P Hubble who discovered during the 1920s the universe constantly is expanding
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan veteran spacewalkers will leave the cabin to assist if necessary
