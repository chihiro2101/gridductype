For the New York Philharmonic it was supposed to be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich
The fates made it a night of Leonard Bernstein
The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74 orchestras
Also added were his ``Chichester Psalms'' (1965) and his overture to ``Candide'' (1956)
The substitute Bernstein program was being repeated Friday night Saturday and Tuesday
It was an extraordinary concert
There weren't many smiling faces among the audience or musicians
Slatkin's brief introductory comments followed by the whimsical ``Candide'' broke some of the tension
It begins with a lyrical praise of the Eros the god of love
The piece is sometimes jocular sometimes melancholy sometimes assaulting and sometimes hedonistic
Last on the program was another Hebraic elegy ``Chichester Psalms''
