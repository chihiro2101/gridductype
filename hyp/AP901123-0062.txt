Former President Reagan thanked British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other allies backed down heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads off into the sunset
``Margaret Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity'' Reagan said in a statement after Mrs Thatcher announced her impending retirement
``I could always count on her wise counsel her firm support and her loyal friendship'' Reagan said
Reagan and the prime minister dubbed the Iron Lady formed a formidable duo in the 1980s and made no secret of their mutual regard
Two years ago as they met for the final time before Reagan left office the president said he was leaving the White House with ``considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at No 10 Downing Street''
Both leaders adopted a hard line toward the Soviet Union but were quick to warm up to Soviet President Mikhail S Gorbachev as the Cold War thawed
