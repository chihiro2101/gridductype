Investigators aboard the USS Iowa searched for clues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and grief-stricken families dealt with the loss of their loved ones
Officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worst disaster to strike a Navy ship in more than a decade a blast that ripped through the Iowa's No 2 gun turret during naval exercises Wednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico
Although naval gunnery experts combed the vessel Thursday their task was complicated by the absence of survivors from the swiveling gun housing where the explosion occurred
Eleven men escaped from powder magazines located deep within the ship at the base of the turret
``We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he returned to Washington from a NATO meeting in Brussels
As the Iowa headed toward its home port in Norfolk Va the flag-draped metal coffins containing the bodies of the 47 seamen killed arrived at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware site of the largest military mortuary
The bodies had been airlifted by helicopter from the Iowa while it was anchored offshore from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico and placed on the cargo plane for the flight home
None of the four battleships of the Iowa class which saw service in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars had previously experienced such an explosion Pentagon officials said
