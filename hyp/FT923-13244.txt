RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union Reuter reports from Moscow
Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia
Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali
South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia which was assigned to Russia by Stalin
