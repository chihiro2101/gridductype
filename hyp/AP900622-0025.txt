The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988
Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran the Dec 7 1988 earthquake in Armenia killed about 25000 people
``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia'' said Russ Needham a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey
The Armenian quake was measured at 69 on the Richter scale but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 77 according to the US Geological Survey
