A drug that eases the heart's workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks according to a major study released Thursday
The study conducted in Denmark found that the drug Verapamil known as a calcium channel blocker was effective for the 1{ years after a heart attack
Calcium blockers are among several classes of medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure
``This is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction'' or heart attack said Dr Carl J Pepine of the University of Florida
Several other studies of calcium blockers including one large US study published last year failed to find any benefit from using the medicines after heart attacks
According to the Danish study Verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks
While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart attacks the researchers said these drugs still should have a role in treatment
Many patients do not tolerate beta blockers'' said Dr Kresten Mellemgaard of Central County Hospital in Hillerod Denmark a co-author of the study
