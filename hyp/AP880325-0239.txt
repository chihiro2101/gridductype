What do Charlie Chaplin Greta Garbo Cary Grant Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common
They have never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements
Oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
The latest casualties are directors James L Brooks whose movie ``Broadcast News'' was nominated though he wasn't and Spielberg who was left out in the cold with his ``Empire of the Sun''
Although ``Broadcast News'' won seven major nominations including best picture and three acting categories Brooks was strangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch
Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated the chances of the once-favored ``Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced
Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' won six nominations this year none of them major and none for director
Two years ago ``The Color Purple'' received 11 nominations but not for him as director
Charlie Chaplin received one at the first Academy Awards for his creation of ``The Circus'' and again at the 44th awards for ``the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century''
(there were 10 nominees in those days) for Orson Welles' performance direction and co-scripting with Herman Mankiewicz Gregg Toland's camera work plus art direction sound music and editing
Billy Wilder's classic comedy ``Some Like It Hot'' failed to be nominated as best picture as did Chaplin's ``Modern Times''
