The government on Thursday allowed for the possibility of a reunified Germany but said such a state must be formed gradually and respect Poland's borders
In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on the issue Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament the two German states could be joined as part of the process of uniting Europe
``A reunited Germany will not be created tomorrow or the day after tomorrow'' Skubiszewski said
Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers ``no political changes in Europe but there should be all kinds of economic integrations''
The specter of a powerful reunited Germany has troubed many Poles especially the older ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland that began World War II
