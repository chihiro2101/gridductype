The image of a dour shoeless English boy and his absent carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and Geoffrey Giuliano to collaborate on a book
The boy is the public image of young John Lennon Baird's half-brother and Giuliano's idol
But the neglected urchin and his live-it-up mother
_ never existed the authors say
``That woman laughing singing dancing saying goodbye to John and John standing there alone crying `Mummy Mummy'
That's not my brother that's not my mother that's not my children's grandmother'' said Baird who recently spent three weeks in the United States promoting her book a family portrait of Lennon and his Liverpool roots
Published in North America last fall ``John Lennon My Brother'' was co-authored by Giuliano a Beatles aficionado who lives in this Erie Canal city about 25 miles north of Buffalo
The result is a little of both a mishmash of anecdotes showing a moody but generally happy Liverpool boy singing with his mother in a bathroom with good acoustics
Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his father decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister Mimi Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother
Baird a 41-year-old teacher in Cheshire England was born seven years after Lennon to Julia and her common-law second husband John Dykins
She and her younger sister Jacqui grew up with their parents amid an extended family of aunts uncles cousins _ and big brother John
The book got its start after Baird watched a British television special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder
Then she met Giuliano who was in Liverpool to promote his first book ``The Beatles A Celebration''
With a collection of rare early photos the book is more a family album than a biography
After Julia was killed in a traffic accident in 1958 Baird saw less and less of Lennon losing contact with him for years when he and wife Yoko Ono moved to the United States
The end of the book describes what Baird calls Lennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots when she and her step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80
Also shown the door was Albert Goldman whose sordid biography ``The Lives of John Lennon'' hit bookstores about the same time as Baird's book
