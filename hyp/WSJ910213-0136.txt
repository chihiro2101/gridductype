John G Tower conservative Republican senator from Texas son of a respected Methodist preacher boozed it up and fooled around
His first marriage fell apart his second made him miserable
All the while he preened himself as the first statewide Republican officeholder since Reconstruction
St John the Divine as he himself acknowledges with semi-charming candor in "Consequences A Personal and Political Memoir (Little Brown 388 pages $2295)
If that was all there was to "Consequences" we could scan the dust jacket and invest our savings in local real estate
"Consequences" reads a bit like a political Stephen King story as the small senator swelled into a Beltway monster
Politics never has been for the squeamish but the Tower controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did the senator's caperings (which mostly took place in the '70s anyway)
Given Mr Tower's qualifications for the job -- intelligence patriotism and past chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee -- the nomination should have sailed through with flying colors
When the Tower hearings opened all manner of accusations came to public notice
The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claimed to have seen the senator consorting with A Lady
The second wife whom the senator had recently divorced possessed a repertory of tales she cheerfully volunteered
Dirt is dirtier than purity is pure as one of John O'Hara's characters observes
Sen Nunn made the campaign personal says Mr Tower -- vote for me or vote for him
