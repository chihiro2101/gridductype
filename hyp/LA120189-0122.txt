As a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland 7000 miles away supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match Thursday night with supporters of President Corazon Aquino at the Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles
About 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better Philippines held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on Wilshire Boulevard to express sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade Lt Col Gregorio Honasan
"We are calling for Mrs Aquino to step down immediately" said Milo Castelo 45 a Los Angeles attorney
Castelo and a handful of the protesters then entered the office building and took the elevator to the 12th-floor consulate where a coalition of four Filipino groups in Los Angeles that support the Aquino government had just completed a press conference
Half a dozen television news crews watched as the anti-government protesters confronted the acting consul general for the Philippines in Los Angeles Willy C Gaa
Greg Santillas of the Campaign for Democracy and Independence said he believes that most of the estimated 350000 Filipinos living in Los Angeles County oppose the military coup
