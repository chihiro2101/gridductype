The resignation of the land reform secretary raises doubts about President Corazon Aquino's commitment to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government criticized for lack of vision
The controversy climaxed Thursday with the resignation of Secretary-designate Florencio Abad 35 whose nomination was opposed by the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party
It also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her rhetoric Mrs Aquino does not share the deep commitment to social change which they expected when she took power in the 1986 ``people power'' uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos
Land reform ``the centerpiece program of her administration is dead''
Abad's troubles began in February when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of government land in Cavite province to Japan's Marubeni Corp for an industrial park
Although the deal was approved by the National Development Corp Abad a former congressman said the land should be distributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program
The Manila press transformed Abad into a folk hero depicting him as the champion of the farmer against political barons of the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party dubbed ``Landlord-Dominated Party''
``Worry not about Abad's destiny Mrs President'' wrote columnist Carol Arguillas in The Manila Chronicle
Last year Agrarian Reform Secretary Philip Juico resigned after disclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sums for marginal land
His successor Miriam Defensor Santiago was repeatedly rejected by the Commission on Appointments only to be reappointed until Mrs Aquino replaced her with Abad on Dec 31
But Mrs Santiago claims she did not display sufficient public loyalty to Mrs Aquino during a coup attempt in early December
