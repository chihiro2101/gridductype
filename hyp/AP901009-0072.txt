The 50th anniversary of John Lennon's birth was observed with a global celebration today as his peace anthem ``Imagine'' was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130 nations
The song was played shortly after 10 am following a brief ceremony at the United Nations that featured the ex-Beatle's widow Yoko Ono
Marcela Perez de Cuellar wife of the UN secretary general also provided a brief introduction
A recorded message from the slain Beatle was played as well
``In celebration of John's life let's use our power of dreaming'' Ono said
``Let's dream of all races praising one another in the knowledge that the differences are what makes the human race''
The UN Trusteeship Council Chamber was about one-third full with a couple of hundred people for the observance and about 150 people watched on television monitors in the visitors' lobby
Jeff Pollack head of the California-based Pollack Media Group proposed the idea to Ono who gave it the go-ahead
Lennon was born Oct 9 1940 and helped lead the Beatles to international stardom along with co-members Paul McCartney George Harrison and Ringo Starr
