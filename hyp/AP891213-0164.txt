The government has decided to give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Josef Stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years Tass reported Wednesday
We're working on creating such autonomy'' said Rafik Nishanov chairman of a chamber of the Soviet legislature in remarks carried by the official news agency
The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II when Josef Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas
The Tatars and Germans among others long have been agitating to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated
It was also a potentially dangerous precedent The Soviet Union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic groups and many of them have outstanding territorial claims
Their protests near the Kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return to their homeland were among the first tests of President Mikhail S Gorbachev's promises of greater democracy
A wave of some 100000 ethnic Germans emigrated to West Germany this year but many would probably stay if they could be assured of their own republic said Irina Ostroukh a researcher at the Soviet Institute of Ethnography who studies ethnic Germans
