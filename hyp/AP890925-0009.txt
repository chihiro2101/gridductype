Three decades ago a West German politician said German reunification was a ``sleeping lioness'' that would awake one day with a mighty roar
Now there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate Europe
``Reunification is coming closer but I can't say whether it will take 10 15 or 20 years'' says West German conservative lawmaker Eduard Lintner
The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East German leader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalist West has revived international interest in the debate
Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream the idea of German reunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush and something short of a categorical ``no'' from President Mikhail S Gorbachev of the Soviet Union
The West German constitution calls for a united Germany but it has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at the end of World War II
It is a prospect that creates unease in Britain and France and in Poland in the East bloc
``Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guarantees from Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances'' the Times' futuristic view continued
That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosens its hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms
The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and other barriers to link the two German states are enormous and for many ominous
West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation and despite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of many Soviet bloc neighbors
A unified Germany could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux as democratic movements sweep parts of the Soviet bloc
Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from Washington and Moscow
``The Cold War was conducted in the name of freedom and today if the coming of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the Federal Republic we ought not to be opposed''
