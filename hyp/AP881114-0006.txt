Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the outside'' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity experts say
Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies
``Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more
With Quayle it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals'' said Ryan Barilleaux a professor of political science at Miami University in Oxford Ohio who studies the American presidency
The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to the same papers information and intelligence that is available to the president
But he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give Quayle
Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration's anti-drug efforts
Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except George Bush'' Barilleaux says
Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration ``I didn't live in this century''
Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute says Quayle while ``not the world's leading intellectual'' is not ``a complete dummy''
He was simply thrust into a situation for which he was unprepared
But Quayle comes to the White House with ``a very damaging stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the political community and that's believed by a large segment of the electorate''
``The natural response is to use him (Quayle) sparingly as Nixon did with Agnew in 1968''
``Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone'' Mahe says
