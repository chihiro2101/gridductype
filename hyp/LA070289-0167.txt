Soviet President Mikhail S Gorbachev warned the nation Saturday night that the country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms
Appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country Gorbachev made clear the leadership's fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that could tear the Soviet Union apart
As president Gorbachev said it is his "duty to warn you about the mounting danger of worsening inter-ethnic relations and the consequences for society for every family and for every person"
"The fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake" he declared in a sober 20-minute address broadcast on radio and television "
"The living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers involved in time to prevent madness"
With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic republics of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances
Roving gangs armed with hunting rifles gasoline bombs and other weapons had clashed in three towns south of the capital of Tbilisi last week leaving one man dead and 22 people seriously wounded
Although limited so far in scope some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war Gorbachev suggested and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors
Although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in late July and then debated again by the Congress of People's Deputies the country's new national assembly Gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis
The refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on minority groups in several parts of the country Gorbachev said alluding to the particularly vicious assaults on Mesketian Turks in Uzbekistan last month in which about 100 people died
