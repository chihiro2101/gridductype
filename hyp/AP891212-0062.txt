The Communist Party today admitted that East Germany's socialist system has failed and expressed support for a type of partnership with West Germany
The statement in the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland was one of the bluntest official assessments to date of the country's increasingly troubled situation
It came a day after shouting matches broke out over German reunification during pro-democracy protests in Leipzig and Dresden
Also today Secretary of State James A Baker III urged caution on the reunification issue
He visited the Berlin Wall and met with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier Hans Modrow
The paper repeated the Communists' promise to work for a new ``democratic socialism'' within a multi-party system
During the past few weeks both Germanys have increased business and cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closer relations since the East Berlin government rejects calls for reunification
Others opposing reunification urged ``No Fourth Reich'' and no transformation of East Germany into West Germany's ``plantation''
