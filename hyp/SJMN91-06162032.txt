Thousands of Americans piled into cars and buses with dogs cats and duffel bags and left Clark Air Base today after scientists warned that the eruption of a nearby volcano could turn catastrophic
The decision to evacuate one of the largest overseas US military bases was made early today after searing gases ash and rock shot out of 4795-foot Mount Pinatubo on Sunday at speeds of up to 60 mph
The volcano about 10 miles west of the air base came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy
The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said it detected rhythmic ground movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of the craters
Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones"
But he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption 600 years ago the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of Clark
Rains fell across the area Sunday night and officials warned residents in the lush green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to escape mud flows
Air Force spokesman Lt Col Ron Rand announced the evacuation in a 5 am broadcast over the US military's Far East Network
The base is a major terminal for the worldwide network of flights operated by the Military Airlift Command
The miles-long convoy jammed the two-lane roads leading to Subic about 50 miles southwest of Clark
US Marines patrolled the highways which pass through areas where Communist guerrillas operate and US helicopters hovered overhead
Mount Unzen and Mount Pinatubo belong to the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific where shifting plates of the Earth's crust push against each other triggering periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes
