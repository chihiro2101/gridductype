Weather forecasters today were offering drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months
A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said ``many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months''
The disappointing forecast came as President Reagan headed to the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms
On Tuesday the Agriculture Department reported sharp declines in the outlook for several crops
That was followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken areas from the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short of rain
The outlook also says there's a 55 percent chance of hotter than normal temperatures through the US heartland from New England to Idaho and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma
