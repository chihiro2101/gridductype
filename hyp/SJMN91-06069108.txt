A one-day strike by coal miners in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine has grown into a nationwide walkout involving up to 100000 miners demanding President Mikhail Gorbachev surrender power to the restive republics a union leader said Friday
They understand that we're not like the phony unions they had before" said Pavel Shushpanov chairman of the executive committee of the 5-month-old Independent Union of Miners
Most of the country's 12 million coal miners are still working but output in some key regions has been halved saddling Gorbachev with a substantial labor and fuel problem even as he struggles to revive the Soviet economy
It began March 1 as a warning action in the Karaganda coal field of Kazakhstan and the Krasnoarmeisk area of the Ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country's major coal regions
Tass the strike has spread to the Donetsk coal basin of the Ukraine the Vorkuta and Inta regions of northern Russia and the Kuznetsk coal basin of western Siberia
