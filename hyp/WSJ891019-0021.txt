The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly
In the aftermath of the California earthquake President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning
Mr Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now
By noon Mr Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle who was in California made a televised statement of concern signed a disaster proclamation received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and visited FEMA headquarters
