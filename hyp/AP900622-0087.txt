The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during international talks in East Berlin on the strategic future of a united Germany
The remarks a copy of which were obtained by The Associated Press indicates that a united Germany would be free to join the Western NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period
Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with US Secretary of State James A Baker III and their counterparts from Britain France and the two German states
The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been staunchly opposed
