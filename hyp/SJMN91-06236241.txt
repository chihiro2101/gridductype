Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin today pressed ahead with a sweeping purge of coup supporters and the Communist Party suffered a series of stunning blows for not opposing the coup plotters
Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister Alexander Bessmertnykh and the Communist Party was banned from the KGB which for decades helped enforce Communist rule
Gorbachev told an audience at the Russian parliament that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover
They wanted to annihilate us and for that they must bear the severe responsibility" the Soviet president said
Gorbachev and Yeltsin the Russian Federation leader who saved Gorbachev met today for the first time since the coup collapsed to discuss the takeover and deal with officials who backed the putsch
Yeltsin has been a strong foe of Communist Party influence in the country
Yeltsin commented frequently during Gorbachev's speech and Gorbachev deferred to him several times on details of what happened while Gorbachev was in detention
The president of Russia Yeltsin    was to be arrested that is how I understood it" Gorbachev said adding the coup plotters intended to isolate Yeltsin
As the face of the Soviet government continued to change in the aftermath of the 63-hour coup hundreds of angry citizens marched toward Communist Party headquarters in Moscow intent on proving the party was behind the coup
He suspended the publication of six Communist Party newspapers and ordered new chiefs for the official Novosti and Tass news services charging that they had supported the takeover
In a major blow to the crumbling party the acting head of the KGB today banned Communist Party activity in the security service Tass said
A KGB directive also banned any other political parties in the KGB for decades used by Communist regimes to intimidate dissidents and anti-Communist activists
In in his speech to the Russian Federation parliament Gorbachev said of Bessmertnykh "this morning I got information that at least he was trying to maneuver or worse" during the coup attempt
Also dismissed was Soviet parliamentary speaker Anatoly Lukyanov whom Yeltsin had named as the chief ideologue of the plotters
Yeltsin who stature rose with his resistance in the coup said earlier that he would insist that proven reformers be installed in top jobs
