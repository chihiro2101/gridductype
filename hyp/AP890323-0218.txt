Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
And with the flood of Oscar vote enticements _ from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners _
Academy members are acknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee in violation of the rules
Secretaries spouses and friends several Academy members say are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition
``It's like a local election of judges'' said Academy member Harry Clein who said he's witnessed team voting
But I've never been through an election in Argentina''
``Members are on the honor system to fill out the ballot themselves''
The Academy's actors branch for example is the only group to select nominees in the four acting categories
Ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied he said
Nominations for acting directing art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of Academy members
Winners for best documentary feature best animated short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those members who have seen all the nominees
Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar victory have on a film's fortunes it's not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars
``I have in my house more color reproductions of Sigourney Weaver and a beautiful gorilla than I need'' Reiner said of promotional material sent to his home
