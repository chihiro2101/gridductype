Philippine Vice President and opposition leader Salvador H Laurel declined Saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels "have the right" to try to seize power
Laurel also said that the rebels will not surrender to President Corazon Aquino's forces as she has demanded
He predicted that the fighting may turn to civil war if reported rebel reinforcements arrive from Cebu Mindanao and other islands
"I don't think this is going to end right away" he said in a suite in the Peninsula Hotel here
"I think it's going to be a long protracted thing even civil war"
Laurel who is known as Doy broke with Aquino shortly after they took office in 1986 following a popular uprising that toppled former President Ferdinand E Marcos
He flew to Hong Kong but was stranded here with scores of journalists because the Philippines' two international airports in Manila and Cebu have been closed since the fighting began
Laurel said 18 Nacionalista leaders were meeting at the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila late Saturday despite the presence of rebel holdouts in the hotel
