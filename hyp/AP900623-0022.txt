Iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say
``The regime is very much fearful of public outrage'' said Shahin Gobadi spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran
As Gobadi spoke Friday members of the organization denounced Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House
Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring between 73 and 77 on the Richter Scale
Iran has told the United Nations that the death toll is at least 36000 but Gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100000
Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and militants seized the US Embassy in Tehran taking 66 Americans hostage
Dymally a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through non-government groups
