It is a sensational shortlist a bestseller about love and hypnotism a blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it
Out are the eminences gris of Victorian letters - novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt didn't make the grade
This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced by six judges including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg

George du Maurier's Trilby Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda George Moore's Esther Waters Kipling's Jungle Book
George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide
The winner will be revealed on October 15 (four days after the 1994 Booker Prize ceremony) at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature

On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend
Both for instance have books about colonial exploitation - Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise which is set in the First World War in German East Africa
Last week a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love The Folding Star on the Booker list because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics

The trick works - last year's winner Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360000 hardback copies
Between 1861 and 1894 when the population of the UK was half that of today and the literate population smaller still Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400000 copies
All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names they were also serious skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later
