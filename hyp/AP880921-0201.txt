When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon'' his first move was to mail a long reverential request for help to Yoko Ono
``She was Numero Uno you've got to start with her
I sent her a sincere letter because at that time I was a true believer in rock's greatest love story
And after 1200 interviews and 6{ years the dream was over for Goldman his mythic view of Lennon the Great altered
Expecting the best Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst a volatile debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes of rock 'n' roll tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time
That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing it also taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson
``My books are a cold dose of reality
Goldman whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis Presley and Lenny Bruce remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy Paul McCartney
For example he cites Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Graceland in 1965
Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono McCartney Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame because he's no longer around to answer the allegations
Colonel Parker (Presley's manager) isn't dead
They hear Albert Goldman John Lennon homosexuality _ bang let him have it
``These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest documentaries when they're in-house documentaries'' said Goldman who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show
