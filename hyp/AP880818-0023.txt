Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas Jefferson and John F Kennedy
Sen John Warner of Virginia who served with Quayle on a Senate subcommittee told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana senator speak ``I'd say `there stands the next Thomas Jefferson'''
And added Warner ``he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia''
Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy a Democrat
``John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years before he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years''
But he doesn't like it when people say he looks like movie idol Robert Redford
The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the 1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage
