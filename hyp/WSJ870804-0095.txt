The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation
The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africa's gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines said Cyril Ramaphosa the union's general secretary
If workers in mines not included in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes a total of 300000 miners could be on strike he said
The union's announcement produced little immediate reaction on South African financial markets where analysts said a strike had been expected and probably wouldn't have much impact unless it lasted more than a month
Anglo American Corp the huge South African mining house warned against a strike saying miners had received a good wage increase in July and wouldn't gain further raises by a job action
He said such other companies included De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd the world's largest diamond miner
