Meanwhile Havana Radio reported today that 25000 people were evacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba's southeastern coast as strong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island
All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport while flights from Grand Cayman the main island of the three-island chain arrived packed with frightened travelers
``It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time'' said Hal Gerrish forecaster at the National Hurricane Center
``We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be a major threat to the United States'' said Martin Nelson another meteorologist at the center
