Virginia Thomas is a soft-spoken hard-working daughter of the heartland
A brainy Omaha Neb lawyer who has scaled the sheer cliffs of professional Washington
A churchgoer who invites homeless people out to lunch

They see a woman with strong opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court
Some women's-rights activists are upset by her lobbying against such issues as comparable-worth legislation

Clarence Thomas advocates a colorblind society and his marriage may be an example of that philosophy
