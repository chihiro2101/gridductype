Nothing so important has happened in Soviet politics since 1917 when the Bolsheviks seized power
In Moscow on Wednesday the system the Bolsheviks and Joseph Stalin created finally collapsed
A new historical epoch began
Soviets had an experience comparable to those that transformed the outlooks of Poles Hungarians Czechs and Slovaks in 1989 when they learned they could finally be free
The "coup people" as President Bush dubbed them could not have miscalculated more profoundly
They thought the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev and apparently believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening everyone else they could quickly take charge of the country
But the people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not Gorbachev himself but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created
But almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the democratic revolution it tried to choke
It seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations -- especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule
Gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late 20th century but this week he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him
One was the ability to stay close to the Russian people as their world was transformed by Gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's abysmal standing in the polls
But these were representatives of the political class that turned one of the world's richest nations into a basket case
