There are events one never forgets
Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was assassinated
And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget
I was in a trailer just outside the stadium about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit
To me the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October 1987 mainly because I was awake this time
