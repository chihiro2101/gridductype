The international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet Union
The problem is indeed a pressing one
The disputes in the Transcaucasus central Asia and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union are causing great suffering for those involved
The Russians fear that if they do nothing the conflicts will worsen and probably spread
They argue that they have a legitimate concern in trying to resolve conflicts that threaten their security
Equally these disputes are of legitimate concern to Britain its western partners and the whole international community both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability
If uncontrolled they pose a variety of threats to European security including increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism
This has meant that even though the west lacks the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots it has been wary of appearing to endorse Russian involvement instead in case it had imperial tendencies
If we are to fashion a joint approach by Russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union we must address all these concerns
If the Russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community the west in turn needs guarantees that Russia will not regard recognition of its involvement as giving it carte blanche in the former Soviet Union
These principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the parties to the conflict focus attention and where possible resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former Soviet Union
Although the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the UN lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process
The CSCE and other international institutions can play an important role here drawing the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on ways of promoting democratic values and principles
