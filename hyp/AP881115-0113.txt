The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks now routinely done at many large hospitals is unnecessary and should be abandoned according to a major study released Tuesday
Some experts said the results are good news because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals where angioplasty is not available
The study also has an important financial message
``This trial has settled one of the most important questions in modern-day cardiology'' commented Dr J Ward Kennedy of the University of Washington Seattle
The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction Trial or TIMI-II directed by Dr Eugene Braunwald of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston
The latest study presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving TPA
Sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart arteries to squeeze them open
Dr Thomas J Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented ``We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery''
``This ultimately makes it possible for patients to be treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care centers if angioplasty is needed'' said Dr Howard Morgan immediate past president of the heart association
