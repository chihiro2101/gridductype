A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has raised objections from some faculty and students
Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring Mandela on May 13 ending a long effort by students seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony
The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner
They hung a banner from the second floor of the law library that said ``Honor Nelson Mandela''
Before he was imprisoned said third-year law student Sarah Ottinger ``Nelson Mandela was an  attorney and an activist who worked against apartheid
University spokesman Paul Jones said letters were sent to Mandela's wife Winnie and his two daughters Zenani a student at Boston University and Makaziwe a student at the University of Massachusetts at Boston
