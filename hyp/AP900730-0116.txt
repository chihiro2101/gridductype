East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried the official news agency ADN reported Monday
ADN quoting a Health Ministry statement said Honecker was still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January and was not well enough to be incarcerated
Honecker 77 ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government and the opening of the Berlin Wall
It said former secret police chief Erich Mielke former economics czar Guenter Mittag and former labor chief Harry Tisch were under arrest while the other four remained free
