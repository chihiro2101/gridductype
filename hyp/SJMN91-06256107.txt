Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness but no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation seems to be emerging
Several senators were openly skeptical Wednesday over Thomas' insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion
Kohl was today's leadoff questioner as the hearings entered their third day
Two pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- Howell Heflin D-Ala and Arlen Specter R-Pa -- also voiced concern about Thomas' answers
Thomas a black federal appeals judge was picked by President Bush to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall the high court's only black justice
Thomas who sat alone at the witness table with no notes or reference materials also claimed a lack of familiarity with the subject matter when asked about some of his former speeches and articles
That moved committee Chairman Joseph Biden D-Del to give Thomas a stack of the judge's past speeches so the nominee could "help me understand them" during future questioning
Outside the hearing room abortion-rights advocates said Thomas should not be allowed to disavow past comments they say show he would vote to ban most if not all abortions
Sen Patrick Leahy D-Vt said he could not understand how Thomas' prior statements touching on the 1973 abortion decision could have been made without considering its content
Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina Orrin Hatch of Utah Charles Grassley of Iowa Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers
But they hope Sens Edward M Kennedy D-Mass and Howard Metzenbaum D-Ohio will be joined by the three swing-vote senators and Biden Leahy Simon and Kohl in voting against the nominee
Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas are scheduled to run through Friday this week and every weekday except Wednesday next week
