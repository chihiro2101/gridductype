The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military leaders of the World War II era one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the European or Asian continents
The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during the war was never clear to us
He may not have had that kind of influence now but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with religious vigor
At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government Hirohito was spared punishment because "it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors"
