His frail body attached to a respirator and a hemodialysis blood-cleansing machine Marcos is unconscious most of the time but occasionally shows faint signs of life doctors in Hawaii said
One radio station broadcast an interview with Marcos' wife Imelda at the St Francis Medical Center in Honolulu where she was said to be maintaining a vigil at his bedside
"I regret to inform Mrs Marcos that as much as I agree that Mr Marcos has his rights I still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions of Filipinos" Aquino told reporters at the presidential palace
Aquino's national security adviser Rafael Ileto told reporters Friday that the Philippine army is prepared for any emergency that might be provoked by the death of the former president
