The most intense hurricane on record surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds leveling slums pummeling posh resorts and forcing tens of thousands to flee
Hurricane Gilbert which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless slackened somewhat as it swirled over land but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the US Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph
The storm was headed west northwest said National Hurricane Center director Bob Sheets
``The area that we have the most likely possibility that this hurricane will make landfall is in the northern part of Mexico or the southeastern southern part of Texas'' he said
At 3 pm today the center of the storm was near latitude 223 north and longitude 929 west or about 380 miles southeast of Brownsville Texas the National Weather Service said
The storm about 450 miles wide hit the Yucatan coast at dawn Wednesday thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves uprooting trees knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines
About 20000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso and other coastal towns a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Mexico City said by telephone today
Ham radio operators in Mexico City also told The Associated Press they had reports of massive damage to several hotels
Authorities were particularly concerned about the people trapped on another resort island just off Cancun tiny Isla Mujeres
In Campeche boats were driven onto the street running along the waterfront Ramon Castillo a night watchman at the newspaper Novedades of Campeche said in a telephone interview
Sheets said the hurricane was expected to hit land midday Friday and that its sustained winds would today ``certainly increase to 130 140 miles per hour''
``Those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairly tight close to the center
