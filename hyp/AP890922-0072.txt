Amid the uproar of live coverage by the major networks and scores of other media organizations National Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring Hurricane Hugo
``The whole system looks chaotic but it works'' said Bob Sheets the center's director
On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank of monitoring equipment were the forecasters making meticulous calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and getting emergency operations going in those areas
On the other side were the media _ a pack of reporters camera operators and technicians jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time and tidbits of his expertise
Surrounded by cameras wires and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones the ubiquitous red-headed meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of Hurricane Hugo
``I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because people are getting clobbered to death'' meteorologist Mark Zimmer said as the storm pounded Charleston SC
