Saudi Arabia an oil-rich ally of Kuwait has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press Agency the day after the Iraqi move
It said Saudi Arabia was following the Kuwait situation ``with extreme concern'' and that King Fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution ``in a manner ensuring the interests of all''
The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwait government was to shelter members of the ruling family including the emir Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah and his crown prince
It was not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade Saudi Arabia as well
Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against Iraq _ closing the pipeline that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea
Iraq's huge armed force is clearly too much for the joint 3000-man Gulf Cooperation Council force based at Hafr al-Baten in northeastern Saudi Arabia 65 miles south of Kuwait
