Janice Trigg's daughter Kerri was among nearly three dozen still missing Saturday night two days after the floods hit eastern Ohio

Searchers for the missing used trained dogs to sniff through the rubble and along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks which empty into the Ohio River in an effort that stretched five miles south of this town
Workers also sifted through debris that collected at the Hannibal locks and dam on the Ohio River about 25 miles south
Relatives of the missing were staying with friends and family said the Rev Robert Gracey who was counseling flood victims at a school turned into a relief center
The friend 9-year-old Amber Colvin was swept down Wegee Creek and into the Ohio River but survived a seven-mile ordeal by clinging to logs
