President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of US troops to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders
The trade embargo bars imports of oil from Iraq which account for 3% to 4% of total US oil supplies officials said
The move also prohibits Iraq from buying US grain and other foodstuffs which represent the other chief element of trade between the two nations
The United States he said would insist on "immediate and unconditional withdrawal" of Iraqi troops
Referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Bush declared "We find his behavior intolerable"
The trade embargo represents the strongest international response so far to Iraq's massive invasion of its small and poorly defended neighbor but it stopped short of the military intervention requested by desperate Kuwait officials
