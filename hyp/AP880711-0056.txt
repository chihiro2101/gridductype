The crippling drought hitting North America is expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries the UN Food and Agriculture Organization reported today
The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1785 billion tons only two million tons more than last year's level which was already below the expected production
If the drought in the United States ended now grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983 when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output the agency reported
If crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate the ratio could drop even further
