Supercomputers satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugo's path into Charleston SC
``All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models'' said Thomas Pyke head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation
``Overall I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a timely manner'' said research meteorologist Colin McAdie
Hurricane specialist Gil Clark who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years said that a couple of decades ago the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships
Meteorology professor Kerry A Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system
