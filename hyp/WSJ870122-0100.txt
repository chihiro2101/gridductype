Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertisers to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena Calif this weekend for an all-out bash
Along with getting seats for Sunday's game the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel
The magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the 104000 fans attending the Super Bowl
And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense
Still the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining -- from an executive sitting in a $1500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs
One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted
Even if it weren't tax deductible it'd be worth it" says Tom Foley chairman of Bibb Co a Macon Ga maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the National Football League team logos
A spokesman for Adolph Coors &amp Co the Golden Colo brewery said its tax advisers instructed executives that "this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business"
Under the old law meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest
That will be a big job for Barron Hilton chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp who along with Alex Spanos owner of the San Diego Chargers is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1800 guests including business leaders entertainment personalities and customers
