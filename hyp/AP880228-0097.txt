Time ran out for the US athletes when the Winter Olympics ended Sunday with a team headed by Brent Rushlaw a tick away from a US bobsled medal and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare
Two of the six were gold medals won by Brian Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed skating
The 250 figure skaters who performed included past and present medal winners as well as young skaters from Albertville France site of the 1992 Winter Games and Seoul South Korea site of this year's summer Games
Athletes marched in carrying miniature Olympic torches and banners reading ``Until We Meet Again'' in eight languages were draped along the top of the stands
Earlier Sunday Rushlaw and his three team members missed winning the first US bobsled medal in 32 years when they was beaten by 02 seconds for the bronze
