The actor who played Little Ricky on the ``I Love Lucy'' show said Wednesday he spent more time with Lucille Ball than he did with his own family in the five years he played the comedian's TV son
Miss Ball died of a ruptured aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Wednesday morning hospital officials said
``She was old and of course I knew about the heart attack so I was not shocked by her death'' said Keith Thibodeaux who at age 6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world
Thibodeaux grew up on the set playing Little Ricky from 1956 until 1961 under Miss Ball's watchful eye
Thibodeaux 38 said he got his break in show business when big band leader Horace Heidt persuaded his father to bring him from Lafayette La to California for the ``Swift Premium Hour'' a traveling radio show that led to a string of one-night stands across the country
``I remember Lucy saying `that's him' and from that time I was Little Ricky'' said Thibodeaux who then used the name Richard Keith
