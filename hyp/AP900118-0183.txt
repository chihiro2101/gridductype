Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype
Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey 63 and Raymond Buckey 31 wept as the verdicts were announced
Jurors found the pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13 other counts
Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges in a new trial
But several parents of former students at the school said the Buckeys won because the system lost
His son now 10 attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a witness at the trial
``The system is not going to protect children'' said Jackie McGauley a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case
Charles Buckey father of Raymond and husband of Mrs Buckey suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin who prosecuted the case for its entire six years was motivated by personal ambition
Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges
``Even if you accept that the children were molested it didn't necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School'' Ms Williams told reporters
Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosian of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election campaign against Ira Reiner who beat him and now runs the district attorney's office
``We never got the children's stories in their own words'' said juror John Breese
Originally there were seven defendants including Raymond Buckey's sister Peggy Ann Buckey and Virginia McMartin the founder of the school mother of Mrs Buckey and grandmother of Raymond Buckey
Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he did what he could to limit its length cutting 50 witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case
there is no such thing as fair'' said Robert Currie whose son attended McMartin but didn't testify at the trial
