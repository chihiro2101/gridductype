With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $10000 and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is scrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished by Hollywood hucksterism
``If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it you risk having your trademark become public domain'' said Bruce Davis the Academy's executive administrator in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter
But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed with Diet Coke Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co beverages
When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditorium and the celebrities tumble out the Coke logo will be on display in front of an audience that includes millions around the world
``It seemed like a good marketing opportunity'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Ira Gleser
``The Academy approached our local bottler in Los Angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people''
For nearly 50 years the Academy has maintained strict security around both the nominations and the award winners
When Malcolm Willits the book store's owner announced that he would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for ``Around the World in 80 Days'' the Academy said enough initiating a court action that for now has blocked any future trophy sales
The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the Academy for a nominal fee
Yet the Academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its trophy's integrity A copyright infringement suit brought against the Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 in a California federal court
