Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or if we are being old-fashioned Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There
In case you did not see that marvellous film this in essence was the plot
a man no one knows anything about a gardener called Chauncey rises without trace to become by the end of the film a serious candidate for the US presidency
Chauncey played by Peter Sellers utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner
In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe
Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener
Francis Wheen of The Guardian a keen student of Major's mysterious past immediately rang 10 Downing Street which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910
I recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city
On the other he is free with insulting references to the European Commission whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics
Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic even in public and so too was Edward Heath even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus politician'
No Major's technique is very much his own invention very much a reflection of his own particular character itself a product of his unsettled family background
