The UN Security Council today overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq including a ban on oil purchases to punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait
The vote was 13-0 with two abstentions by Cuba and Yemen on the 15-member council which adopted the sanctions resolution proposed by the United States
It said Iraq had launched an armed attack against Kuwait and usurped the authority of Kuwait's legitimate government
The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans ``the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution''
President Bush praised the decision and called for ``full and total implementation of these sanctions ruling out nothing at all''
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday the Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations not to take ``punishing measures'' against it or Iraq
