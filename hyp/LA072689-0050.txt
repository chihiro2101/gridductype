Three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees whom Democrats said had no qualifications except political connections won narrow approval Tuesday from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Sen Charles S Robb (D-Va) joined the Republican members as the panel first voted 10 to 9 to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain
Then in voice votes the committee approved the equally controversial nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be ambassador to Australia and Della Newman a Seattle Wash real estate broker to be ambassador to New Zealand
It also approved the nominations of Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the Vatican William Howard Taft IV to be the permanent US representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Keith L Brown to be ambassador to Denmark and Joseph Gildenhorn a Washington lawyer and real estate developer to be ambassador to Switzerland
