'WAL-MART A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S Vance and Roy V Scott Twayne Publishers New York Dollars 1495
240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream
Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen
The church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher Oklahoma he founded a store chain which made him America's richest man and which shortly before his death in 1992 became the world's biggest retailer
His company Wal-Mart made sales of Dollars 55bn last year and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 235bn
Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945 it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store
At the time of its incorporation in 1971 Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers
Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of Sears Roebuck the biggest and 11 per cent of K mart the second-biggest
Rather he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s including Ann and Hope E J Korvette Spartan's Fed-Mart and K mart
Walton learned from them all but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed
