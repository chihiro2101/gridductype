Iraq's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this small oil-rich kingdom
Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and government buildings and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia Kuwaiti officials said
Kuwait's US ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities
"The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait" a Kuwaiti government official shouted in a telephone interview
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed that it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established "the provisional government of free Kuwait"
The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area
In recent days diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100000 troops at the border
Operating from an unknown location al Ahmed's government responded to the formation of the provisional government by stating "Kuwait is Kuwait to its people led by the emir Sheik Jabbar and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad
