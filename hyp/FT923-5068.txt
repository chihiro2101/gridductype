MY STORY By Sam Walton Doubleday Dollars 2250
269 pages Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment as Ross Perot found out
The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright
A vast media circus meanwhile is quick to expose any flaws
Sam Walton founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who died of cancer in April negotiated these pitfalls much better than most
But no one has ever been able to make Sam himself look bad
The worst that has been said is that he was rather dull
Readers will either find his autobiography lashed with 'good ol'' common-sense and a lot of harmless if charming anecdotes
Meanwhile the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his business is inescapable

Sam Walton was a salesman to the core and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called Moon Pies
