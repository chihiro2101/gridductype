In addition to the Leonard Bernstein tribute that is part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic program this weekend other local orchestras are also planning special remembrances
Sunday at Royce Hall the American Youth Symphony has added local composer Leon Levitch's Elegy for Strings -- a personal choice from conductor Mehli Mehta -- to the program to honor Bernstein who died last Sunday
Also opening the new season of the Glendale Symphony season on Sunday at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion music director Lalo Schifrin will observe a moment of silence to honor his longtime friend and colleague
Last Monday KUSC-FM (915) devoted its entire day of live broadcasting from 6 am to 10 pm to performances -- as conductor and pianist -- and compositions of Bernstein including an unusual recording from 1956 of him discussing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
Among the contributors were conductors Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur as well as Peter Martins of the New York Ballet and Christopher Keene of the New York City Opera
