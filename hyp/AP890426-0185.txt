Lucille Ball the daffy comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted viewers for four decades died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery
The actress star of the hugely popular ``I Love Lucy'' and related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries had undergone major heart surgery April 18
She had been recovering steadily getting out of bed and joking with the staff but shortly before dawn Wednesday she went into cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ronald Wise
She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 am and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless Wise said
``There was nothing to indicate this would happen'' Wise said
``The heart itself apparently was not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death''
Kass who performed the operation said at the time the tearing in Miss Ball's aorta ``progressed all the way down into her abdomen''
Miss Ball with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail was considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format
``She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit
``It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 years'' said Miss Ball's frequent sidekick Gale Gordon who was in Edmonton Alberta
While in the hospital the comedian was deluged with thousands of cards letters flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as Australia and Europe
Miss Ball and her late former husband Desi Arnaz starred in ``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated reruns
She and Arnaz established one of TV's first major independent studios
In 1961 Miss Ball married nightclub comic Gary Morton who became her executive producer and remained on TV for 12 more years in the weekly ``
Miss Ball was born Aug 6 1911 in Jamestown NY the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist
As a blonde she appeared with the Marx Brothers in ``Room Service'' with Fred Astaire in ``Follow the Fleet'' and with Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in ``Stage Door''
In 1940 her tresses colored the fiery trademark red Miss Ball met Arnaz a rumba star
In 1951 when CBS decided to move her radio series ``My Favorite Husband'' to television Miss Ball insisted that Arnaz be her co-star
The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved audiences would watch a leggy blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born band leader with a heavy accent
