Marilyn Quayle wife of Vice President Dan Quayle praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northern Alabama city's residents during a visit Saturday
Mrs Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris left by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured at Crestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour
The tornado left 18 people dead hundreds injured and up to 1000 homeless
``The community is filled with heroes _ people who without  regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so that they could survive'' said Mrs Quayle who was accompanied by Gov Guy Hunt and US Sens
Mrs Quayle who made similar visits to San Francisco after the Oct 17 earthquake and Charleston SC after Hurricane Hugo also praised corporations that have made donations to help Huntsville recover
Federal and state officials have promised to do whatever is necessary to help Huntsville even if disaster relief funds are squeezed by Hurricane Hugo and the quake
President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area but FEMA may have to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash of natural disasters
``Any one disaster like Hugo or the earthquake in California exceeds  what we have in a normal year alone'' Peterson said
Peterson said he's not yet concerned about FEMA meeting its financial obligations
Peterson and his aides urged patience during the arduous task of processing thousands of relief requests from the Huntsville area
The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost of providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims with the federal government pitching in the other 75 percent
He requested donations to agencies such as the American Red Cross which set up a shelter for the homeless as rescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hours after the tornado struck
The tornado hit Huntsville with devastating force _ winds were estimated at 250 mph _ and virtually no warning about 430 pm
Three churches two schools 35 businesses and 10 public buildings were either destroyed or suffered heavy damage
