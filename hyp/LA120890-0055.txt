Queen Elizabeth II awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the coveted Order of Merit on Friday and made her husband a baronet which is a hereditary knighthood
From now on Denis Thatcher will be formally addressed as Sir Denis and his wife as Lady Thatcher although she insisted Friday she wished to be known simply as "Mrs Thatcher"
"I have done pretty well out of being Mrs Thatcher" said the former prime minister who resigned Nov 22 during a fight for the leadership of the Conservative Party
As a member of the Order of Merit created in 1902 Thatcher joins such luminaries in the world of arts science and politics as philosopher Isiah Berlin historian Veronica Wedgwood writer Graham Greene violinist Yehudi Menuhin and artist Sidney Noland as well as honorary member Mother Teresa
