President Mikhail S Gorbachev met Tuesday with East German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open toward eventual German reunification
Modrow told reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev ``did not rule out such a prospect in the future and at the same time did not venture to set some time limits for that''
Earlier the Kremlin chief said any such decisions must include the four Allied powers and take into account European opinions
``Time itself is acting on this process giving it dynamism'' Gorbachev said
Tass said Gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuring relations between the two Germanys must involve ``all directly interested governments''
Gorbachev in comments to reporters after meeting French President Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December reiterated his view that the existence of two German states is a fact based on the outcome of World War II
Count Otto Lambsdorff head of West Germany's Free Democratic Party a partner in the governing coalition said Tuesday in London that Gorbachev has adopted ``a more positive attitude'' toward German reunification
In a TV interview on Britain's Channel 4 he also urged ``economic union'' within 18 months as a prelude to full union of West and East Germany
