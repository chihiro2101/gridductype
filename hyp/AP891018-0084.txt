Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco many scientists have believed the next ``big one'' would strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault
But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it also faced another seismic disaster and those studies became a reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 69 on the Richter scale rocked the Bay area
A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a 69-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the San Andreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southward through the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista
The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described in the article but Tom Heaton the scientist in charge of the US Geological Survey office in Pasadena said it wasn't clear yet whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment
The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of Santa Cruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco
The 1985 study by Columbia University geology professor Christopher Scholz was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened Tuesday
The bigger a quake the more stress it relieves and thus the longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again
