The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas and its science instruments were on hold unable to begin any observations
``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now'' said Steve Terry a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope
Discovery's astronauts meanwhile packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight
``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope'' said Bolden
``It makes little kids' eyes light up
``We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode in effect a standby mode'' he said
``We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems'' Olivier said Friday
Landing is scheduled for 948 am EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base Calif but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather
``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope which is now open for business'' said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield
The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home
They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center
The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth
But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning exposing the telescope's finely polished 945-inch eye to starlight for the first time
