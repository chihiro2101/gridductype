An experiment with more than 1700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack
The experiment suggests that doctors could test their patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure to determine how intensively they should be treated to prevent heart attacks researchers said
The experiment indicated that the test can spot those patients with extremely low risk of heart attack as well as those with a high risk
The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin might suggest a new "risk factor" for heart attacks
About half of the 15 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year don't have the known risk factors for heart disease such as high cholesterol levels cigarette smoking obesity and high blood pressure
It is unknown what distinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those who don't suffer heart attacks
The blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk said John H Laragh of the Cardiovascular Center at Cornell University and New York Hospital
Dr Laragh pioneered the research underlying use of the test which was developed by his wife biochemist Jean E Sealey
The blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is
The release of renin is the first step in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises blood pressure
The test is based on the fact that if the salt concentration in the blood rises tending to boost blood pressure the activity of the renin normally drops to offset the effect of the salt
The new experiment was designed to test a theory put forth by Dr Laragh and his colleagues that the activity of the renin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack
Apparently by coincidence Abbott Laboratories announced on Tuesday that is developing a high blood pressure drug that works by inhibiting the activity of renin
A big-selling class of high blood pressure drugs including Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp's Capoten and Merck &amp Co's Vasotec are known as ACE inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin
