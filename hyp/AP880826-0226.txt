Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was created state records show
The law creating the unit passed April 14 1971 and took effect July 1
Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from July until mid-September when he became administrative assistant to then-Gov
Quayle's Senate biography which his campaign is using as his official background says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971
``He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971'' said Robert Smith the unit's first director and now an attorney in Indianapolis
Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane
Earlier however Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland ``a cheap shot''
Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National Guard
In 1980 Quayle referred to himself as a ``Vietnam-era veteran'' in campaign literature when he was running against three-term incumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race
