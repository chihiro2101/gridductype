Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell two sons of the late Robert Maxwell are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions
Sir Robert Clark chairman of MGN lists a series of transactions - some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate - that took place in the past few months
He says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations including Goldman Sachs the US investment bank over more than Pounds 40m in transfers from MGN if the bank was aware that they were 'effected for improper purposes'
Notes to the accounts show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of Pounds 4215m in the year to December 29 1991 including Pounds 2086m in pension deficiencies and Pounds 1224m in transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies
The others were authorised mainly by Mr Kevin Maxwell Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Michael Stoney he says
