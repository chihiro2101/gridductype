Gone from Tiananmen Square are the pro-democracy banners and the tents of China's freedom movement replaced by tanks armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers
The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the capital six days ago leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement for political change
Troops moved back their barricades making it possible for city residents to walk to the edge of the square which for seven weeks stood at the heart of the movement
The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy a 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty was taken by a tread-wheeled armored personnel carrier
Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3600 people were killed and 60000 injured over the weekend citing a Chinese students' organization the Union of Chinese Students in West Germany
A crowd of officials stood on the roof of the Great Hall of the People overlooking the square
From this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant mass of demonstrators enveloped 5000 troops and blocked their entry to the square
