The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gun explosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday as the Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret to blow up
None of the guns in the no 2 turret had been fired before the explosion instantly killed the seamen Navy officials said
They discarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by red-hot debris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds
The Navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium on firing 16-inch guns found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships the New Jersey the Wisconsin and the Missouri
The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk Va while the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1600 crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead
At the White House chief of staff John Sununu announced President Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for the victims in Norfolk
He said the president had heard of the service and told his staff ``if it could be fitted in he wanted to be there  wants to be a part''
Mark Baker chief of the Navy's Pentagon press office said later that none of the turret's three guns had been fired
Only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of a training exercise had been fired he said and all had been from the No 1 turret forward of the one that exploded
Larry Seaquist the ship's former captain _ said a possible explanation was that red-hot debris from a previous round ignited new charges
The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico to unload the bodies which were then flown to Delaware
Around the United States Navy officers and chaplains broke the bad news to the dead men's next of kin
``I've done it many times and I'll never get used to it'' said Cmdr
The commander of the US 2nd Fleet Adm Jerome Johnson who was on board the Iowa told reporters in Puerto Rico ``The fire and explosion was instantaneous''
Cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gun house at the top of the turret rather than the mechanical compartments and ammunition magazines below it
Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked or from a shell that ``cooks off'' _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round
