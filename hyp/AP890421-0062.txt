The 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa which can lob a shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles have an outdated design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age critics say
They all ought to be eliminated'' retired Rear Adm Eugene LaRocque of the Center for Defense Information said Thursday
``I don't know what more it takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no longer appropriate on warships''
But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun the mightiest in use on any ocean after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice
The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed in silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-long barrel
It works like the breech-loaded guns that roared during the Civil War A shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with gunpowder in a separate package
In the Iowa's case 660 pounds of powder _ six 110-pound bags _ is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2700 pounds at a speed of 2500 feet per second
James Bush of the Center for Defense Information a private think tank often critical of Pentagon policy said the Iowa explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris a blowback or a mishap in the handling of powder
``These are the only guns in the Navy that still used bagged powder''
The Navy also on Thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big guns found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships the New Jersey the Wisconsin and the Missouri
