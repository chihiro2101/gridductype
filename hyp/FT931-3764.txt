THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand
The devices mostly car bombs appeared to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart
Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange the landmark Air India building a shopping complex and two hotels near the airport
The identity of the bombers was unknown but the attacks were a severe setback to India's attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence which has caused deep shock throughout India
The bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism
Mr Sharad Pawar the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister of Maharashtra state said all roads into Bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert
