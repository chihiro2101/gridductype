John G Tower has fallen but the sky has not
For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked Tower's path to the Pentagon business is proceeding as usual
President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic assurances of future cooperation
That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the White House
Nevertheless a week after the former Texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens the waters have closed
The good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target
``We've established what will be known as the Tower standards'' said Sen John Warner R-Va
That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright
But it will be a debating point not a turning point in a Wright controversy that was ordained long before the Tower episode
He insisted that Tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed
``That's over'' he said 24 hours after the Tower defeat
Indeed it could turn out that the Senate did the president a favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon
