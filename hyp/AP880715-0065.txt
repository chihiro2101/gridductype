Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current US drought weather experts warned during a drought symposium here
``Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria'' said Pat Michaels Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the symposium
``I'm worried  that when the next drought happens we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem'' said Michaels president of the Association of State Climatologists
However Alan Hecht director of the National Climate Program in Washington DC said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects especially undertaking policies that ``make sense in their own right''
However David Rodenhuis director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington said he was skeptical of Plummer's thesis
