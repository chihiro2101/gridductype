Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts in the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they are deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest costliest criminal trial
Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts
In an interview Wednesday evening Pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts
He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury back
The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey 31 and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey 63 are guilty or innocent of charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach
After conferring with lawyers Pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge ``if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons''
Among those were Buckey's sister Peggy Ann and his grandmother Virginia McMartin who founded the prestigious but now defunct nursery school
