WORKERS AT KGHM Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's pits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies
The strike at KGHM in Lubin western Poland where mining unions representing some 400000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent
Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scattered stoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford
In contrast to the copper industry which continues to show a profit coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the government moved to control the budget deficit
